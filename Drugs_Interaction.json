  "Drug": "acetaminophen",
  "Description": "Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and a fever reducer. Acetaminophen is used to treat mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with opiates, or to reduce fever. Common conditions treated include headache, muscle aches, arthritis, backache, toothaches, sore throat, colds, flu, and fevers. Acetaminophen is also available in many over-the-counter combination medications with other drugs, including Actifed, Alka-Seltzer Plus Liquid Gels, Cepacol, Contac, Coridicin, Dayquil, Dimetapp, Dristan, Excedrin, Feverall, Liquiprin, Midol, Nyquil, Panadol, Robitussin Singlet, Sinutab, Sudafed, Theraflu, Triaminic, Vanquish, Vicks, and Zicam. Acetaminophen is also found in many prescription combination drugs, including Butalbital, Endocet, Fioricet, Hycotab, Hydrocet, Hydrocodone bitartrate, Lortab, Percocet, Phenaphen, Sedapap, Tapanol, Tylenol with codeine, Tylox, Ultracet, Vicodin, and Zydone. Acetaminophen is typically used orally, but can be given intravenously. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to acetaminophen: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "cardiovascular: Many amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are contraindicated in patients with advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic or unstable cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, moderate to severe hypertension, or hyperthyroidism. Like other sympathomimetic amines, amphetamines may cause cardiovascular adverse effects such as palpitation, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, and elevation of blood pressure. Rarely, cardiomyopathy manifested as ventricular hypertrophy and\/or congestive heart failure has been reported during chronic amphetamine use. In addition, sudden death has been reported in association with amphetamine therapy at usual dosages in children with structural cardiac abnormalities. In general, amphetamines should not be used in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities. If not otherwise contraindicated, therapy with amphetamines should be administered cautiously in patients with a current or past history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.;\n\nglaucoma: Some amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or anatomically narrow angles. Like other sympathomimetic amines, amphetamines can induce transient mydriasis. In patients with narrow angles, pupillary dilation can provoke an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma. If possible, these agents should also be avoided in patients with other forms of glaucoma since mydriasis may occasionally increase intraocular pressure.;\n\nagitation: Some CNS stimulants are contraindicated in patients with marked agitation and\/or anxiety since these symptoms may be aggravated. CNS stimulants may also exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in psychotic patients, particularly children. Therapy with CNS stimulants should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of psychosis or a predisposition to agitated states.;\n\ncardiac disease: Many CNS stimulants are contraindicated in patients with significant cardiovascular impairment such as uncompensated heart failure, severe coronary disease, severe hypertension (including that associated with hyperthyroidism or pheochromocytoma), cardiac structural abnormalities, serious arrhythmias, etc. Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who are treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended dosages for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; use of these agents should be avoided in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. Additionally, stroke, myocardial infarction, chest pain, syncope, arrhythmias, and other symptoms have been reported in adults under treatment. A careful assessment of the cardiovascular status should be done in patients being considered for treatment. This includes family history, physical exam, and further cardiac evaluation (EKG and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms should have a detailed cardiac evaluation and if needed, treatment should be suspended.;\n\nglaucoma: The use of most CNS stimulants is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, as these agents exhibit sympathomimetic activity and may induce mydriasis provoking an increase in intraocular pressure.;\n\nhypertension: CNS stimulants increase blood pressure and heart rate; the use of some agents may be contraindicated in patients with severe\/uncontrolled hypertension. Caution should be used when administering to patients with preexisting high blood pressure (even mild hypertension) and other cardiovascular conditions. All patients under treatment should be regularly monitored for potential tachycardia and hypertension.;\n\npsychiatric disorders: The use of CNS stimulants can cause psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, and aggression, and can exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder; CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Psychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients with and without history of psychiatric disorders. All patients (particularly those with psychotic or bipolar disorders) should be monitored closely, especially during treatment initiation and at times of dose changes. Extreme caution should be exercised when CNS stimulants are given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, mania, or bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating therapy, all patients should be screened for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or family history of suicide, bipolar disease, or depression). If any psychiatric symptoms emerge or are exacerbated, treatment suspension should be considered. Some CNS stimulants are contraindicated in patients with marked agitation or anxiety.;\n\nsubstance abuse: CNS stimulants (especially amphetamines) have a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants can result in overdose and death; this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration (e.g., snorting, injection). Before prescribing a CNS stimulant, each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction should be assessed. Throughout therapy, it is recommended to reassess each patient's risk and frequently monitor for signs\/symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Therapy with CNS stimulants should be administered cautiously, if at all, in patients with a history of alcohol or substance abuse. The use of some agents is contraindicated in patients with a history of drug abuse.;\n\ntics: CNS stimulants have been reported to worsen Tourette's syndrome and exacerbate motor and verbal tics. Before initiating therapy, it is recommended to assess family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette's syndrome. Therapy with CNS stimulants, if necessary, should be administered cautiously in patients with tic disorders or family history of Tourette's syndrome. The manufacturers of the CNS stimulants, methylphenidate (racemic) and dexmethylphenidate (the more pharmacologically active d-enantiomer), consider their use to be contraindicated in such patients.;",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "liver disease: In general, CNS stimulants are extensively metabolized by the liver. Their plasma clearance may be decreased and their half-life prolonged in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therapy with CNS stimulants should be administered cautiously in patients with moderate to severe liver disease, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly in certain agents. Additionally, postmarketing reports have shown that atomoxetine can cause severe liver injury; laboratory testing should be done at the first sign\/symptom of liver dysfunction (jaundice, dark urine, upper quadrant tenderness) and treatment should be discontinued in patients with evidence of liver injury.;\n\nrenal dysfunction: Overall CNS stimulants should be administered with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function as the reduction in the rate of elimination may alter the therapeutic response. The dosage should be adjusted accordingly in certain agents.;\n\nseizure disorders: Due to general central nervous system stimulation, therapy with CNS stimulant drugs may cause seizures. These drugs may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with history of seizures, with prior electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities without seizures, and very rarely, without history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. Therapy with CNS stimulants should be used with caution in patients with or predisposed to seizures. If seizures occur, therapy should be discontinued.;\n\ndiabetics: Obese, type 2 diabetic patients who achieve weight loss may demonstrate improved metabolic control of their disease as a result of their reduced weight. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be monitored during weight-reduction therapy (or therapy that may be expected to induce significant weight loss as a secondary effect) for hypoglycemia and reduced need for oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin, and the dosages of these agents adjusted accordingly. Patients should be apprised of the risk of hypoglycemia and be alert to potential signs and symptoms such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, tremor, hunger, weakness, perspiration, and palpitation.;",

Amitriptyline may work by increasing chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) serotonin and norepinephrine that communicate between brain cells and help regulate mood. The first amitriptyline brand was Elavil, which was FDA-approved on April 7, 1961, and has since been discontinued. Other amitriptyline brand names include Vanatrip and Endep, which have also been discontinued. Amitriptyline is now available as a generic medication. Amitriptyline is from the drug class tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Amitriptyline is available in combination with chlordiazepoxide for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe depression associated with moderate to severe anxiety. Amitriptyline, in combination with perphenazine, is FDA-approved for types of severe anxiety and\/or agitation. Common amitriptyline side effects may include dry mouth, vision changes, sleepiness (sedation), tiredness, appetite or weight changes, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, mouth pain, unusual taste, black tongue, urinating less than usual, breast swelling (in men or women), lower sex drive, impotence, or difficulty having an orgasm. Allergic reactions: Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to amitriptyline, including difficulty breathing, hives, or swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as mood or behavior changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile, aggressive, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), more depressed, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You should not use amitriptyline if you have recently had a heart attack. Do not use amitriptyline if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days, such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine. You may have thoughts about suicide when you first start taking an antidepressant such as amitriptyline, especially if you are younger than 24 years old. Your doctor will need to check you at regular visits for at least the first 12 weeks of treatment. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as: mood or behavior changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile, aggressive, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), more depressed, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. Amitriptyline may trigger an angle closure glaucoma attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to amitriptyline or any of the inactive ingredients or: Do not use amitriptyline if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, tranylcypromine, and others. Tell your doctor if you have used an \"SSRI\" antidepressant in the past 5 weeks, such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline (Zoloft), trazodone, or vilazodone. To make sure amitriptyline is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Your doctor should check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Amitriptyline is not approved for use by anyone younger than 12 years old. Take amitriptyline exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. It may take up to 4 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve. If you need surgery, tell your surgeon you currently use amitriptyline. You may need to stop for a short time. Do not stop using amitriptyline suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using amitriptyline. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use. Outpatients: Inpatients: Comments: Dose: 10 mg orally 3 times a day AND 20 mg orally once a day at bedtime Comments: Aimitripyline dose 12 years or older: 10 mg orally 3 times a day AND 20 mg orally once a day at bedtime Comments: Available as amitriptyline 10mg tablets, amitriptyline 25mg tablets, 50mg tablets, 75mg tablets 100mg tablets and 150mg tablets. Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. An overdose of amitriptyline can be fatal. Overdose symptoms may include irregular heart rhythm, feeling like you might pass out, seizures, or coma. Do not drink alcohol. Dangerous side effects or death can occur when alcohol is combined with amitriptyline. Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how amitriptyline will affect you. Your reactions could be impaired. Avoid exposure to sunlight or tanning beds. Amitriptyline can make you sunburn more easily. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when you are outdoors. Taking amitriptyline with other drugs that make you sleepy can worsen this effect. Ask your doctor before taking amitriptyline with a sleeping pill, narcotic pain medicine, muscle relaxer, or medicine for anxiety, depression, or seizures. Sometimes it is not safe to use certain medications at the same time. Some drugs can affect your blood levels of other drugs you take, which may increase side effects or make the medications less effective. Tell your doctor about all your other medicines, especially: This list is not complete. Other drugs may affect amitriptyline, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Not all possible drug interactions are listed here.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "anticholinergic effects: Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have anticholinergic activity, to which elderly patients are particularly sensitive. Tertiary amines such as amitriptyline and trimipramine tend to exhibit greater anticholinergic effects than other agents in the class. Therapy with TCAs should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting conditions that are likely to be exacerbated by anticholinergic activity, such as urinary retention or obstruction; angle-closure glaucoma, untreated intraocular hypertension, or uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma; and gastrointestinal obstructive disorders. In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, even average doses can precipitate an attack. Glaucoma should be treated and under control prior to initiation of therapy with TCAs, and intraocular pressure monitored during therapy.; cardiovascular disease: Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may cause orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, syncope, and dizziness, particularly during initiation of therapy or rapid escalation of dosage. Imipramine appears to have the greatest propensity to induce these effects, while secondary amines such as nortriptyline may do so less frequently. Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks. Rarely, collapse and sudden death have occurred secondary to severe hypotension. Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart block, hypertension, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, strokes, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation. Therapy with TCAs should be avoided during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, and should be administered only with extreme caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or a predisposition to hypotension. Close monitoring of cardiovascular status, including ECG changes, is recommended at all dosages. Many of the newer antidepressants, including bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are considerably less or minimally cardiotoxic and may be appropriate alternatives.; pheochromocytoma: Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may potentiate the effects of circulating catecholamines. Enhanced sympathetic activity can provoke hypertensive crises in patients with pheochromocytoma or other tumors of the adrenal medulla, such as some neuroblastomas. Therapy with TCAs should be administered cautiously in patients with these tumors.; acute myocardial infarction recovery: The use of most tricyclic antidepressants is contraindicated in patients that are going through the acute recovery period after a myocardial infarction.; cardiovascular disease: Tricyclic antidepressants should be used with extreme caution in patients with evidence of cardiovascular disease because of the possibility of fluctuations in the blood pressure, arrhythmias, conduction defects, tachycardia, myocardial infarction and stroke. This also applies to patients who have family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or conduction disturbances. In some cases a gradual dose titration is recommended.; seizure disorders: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), can lower the seizure threshold and trigger seizures. These drugs should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of seizures, or other predisposing factors, such as head trauma, CNS abnormalities, and alcoholism. Daily dose restrictions might apply for specific antidepressants. Physicians are encouraged to get additional dosing recommendations on the manufacturer's prescribing information.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "bone marrow suppression: The use of tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) has rarely been associated with bone marrow suppression. Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, purpura, and pancytopenia have been reported with some TCAs. Patients with preexisting bone marrow suppression or blood dyscrasias receiving TCAs should be monitored closely during therapy for further decreases in blood counts.; diabetes: Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported with the use of some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Rarely, these effects have also occurred with maprotiline, a tetracyclic antidepressant. Patients with diabetes should be monitored for worsening control of blood glucose when treated with these agents, particularly during dosage escalation or whenever dosage has been altered.; renal\/liver disease: Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are known to undergo metabolism in the liver. Some of the metabolites, such as those of imipramine, clomipramine and desipramine, may be pharmacologically active. Many of the metabolites are also excreted by the kidney. There are very limited data concerning the use of TCAs in patients with renal and\/or liver disease. Therapy with TCAs should be administered cautiously in patients with significantly impaired renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.; schizophrenia\/bipolar disorder: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may aggravate symptoms of psychosis in schizophrenic patients, particularly those with paranoid symptomatology. Depressed patients, usually those with bipolar disorder, may experience a switch from depression to mania or hypomania. These occurrences have also been reported rarely with the tetracyclic antidepressant, maprotiline. Therapy with these agents should be administered cautiously in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or a history of mania.; tardive dyskinesia: Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have anticholinergic activity, to which elderly patients are particularly sensitive. Tertiary amines such as amitriptyline and trimipramine tend to exhibit greater anticholinergic effects than other agents in the class. As with other drugs that possess anticholinergic activity, TCAs may aggravate tardive dyskinesia or induce previously suppressed symptoms. Patients with tardive dyskinesia requiring therapy with TCAs should be monitored for exacerbation of the condition.; acute alcohol intoxication: Tricyclic antidepressants can enhance the response to alcohol. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage.; bipolar disorder screening: A major depressive episode can be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. Patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder prior to initiating treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant. This screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that tricyclic antidepressants are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.; glaucoma: Tricyclic antidepressants as other type of antidepressants have an effect on pupil size causing dilation. This effect can potentially narrow the eye angle resulting in increased intraocular pressure and angle closure glaucoma, especially in predisposed patients. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with anatomically narrow angle or history of glaucoma. Doxepin hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma.; hyper\/hypoglycemia: There have been reports of both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia or diabetes. Monitoring sugar levels is recommended.; liver\/renal disease: In general, tricyclic antidepressants should be used with caution in patients with liver or renal disease, as these drugs are metabolized and excreted through the liver and kidneys. Dose selection, especially in the elderly patients that might have liver or renal dysfunction, should usually be limited to the smallest effective total daily dose. Some tricyclic antidepressants such as clomipramine and nortriptyline have occasionally been associated with elevations in SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT), and other hepatic adverse events such as jaundice. Although serious liver injury has only been reported rarely, therapy with these drugs should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting liver disease and periodic monitoring of liver enzyme levels is recommended.; neutropenia: The use of some tricyclic antidepressants has been associated with neutropenia (ANC < 500\/mm3) and agranulocytosis (ANC < 500\/mm3). Leukocyte and differential blood counts should be performed in patients that develop fever and sore throat during treatment. Therapy should be discontinued if there is evidence of pathologic neutrophil depression.; schizophrenia: Some tricyclic antidepressants have shown to cause activation or exacerbation of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. A dosage reduction might be required.; thyroid disorders: Most tricyclic antidepressants should be administered with caution in hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid medication as they may develop arrhythmias when these drugs are given.; urinary retention: Due to their anticholinergic properties, tricyclic antidepressants should be administered with caution in patients with history of urinary retention. Particularly doxepin hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in patients with tendency to urinary retention.",

  "Drug": "amlodipine",
  "Description": "Amlodipine besylate belongs to a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. Amlodipine is used to treat certain types of angina (chest pain) and other conditions caused by coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). Amlodipine besylate controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to the heart. If taken regularly, this medicine controls chest pain, but it does not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain. Amlodipine is also used alone or in combination with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children at least 6 years old. Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack. Amlodipine besylate is available as: The most common amlodipine side may include: Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to amlodipine: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. In rare cases, when you first start taking this medicine, your chest pain may get worse or you could have a heart attack. Seek emergency medical attention or call your doctor right away if you have symptoms such as: chest pain or pressure, pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder, nausea, sweating. Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Before taking amlodipine besylate, tell your doctor if you have congestive heart failure or liver disease. Drinking alcohol can further lower your blood pressure and may increase certain side effects of amlodipine. If you are being treated for high blood pressure, keep using amlodipine even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medication for the rest of your life. Amlodipine is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, and other medications. Follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely. Tell your doctor about all other heart or blood pressure medications you are taking. Your chest pain may become worse when you first start taking amlodipine or when your dose is increased. Call your doctor if your chest pain is severe or ongoing. You should not take amlodipine if you are allergic to it. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: It is not known if amlodipine will harm an unborn baby. However, having high blood pressure during pregnancy may cause complications or medical problems in both mother and baby. The benefit of treating hypertension may outweigh any risks to the baby. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. Take amlodipine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Amlodipine is usually taken once per day. Take the medicine at the same time each day, with or without food. Shake the oral suspension (liquid). Measure a dose with the supplied measuring device (not a kitchen spoon). Your blood pressure will need to be checked often. If you have high blood pressure, keep using amlodipine even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. Do not change your doses or stop taking any of your medications without your doctor's advice. Your treatment may also include diet, exercise, weight control, and blood tests. Store amlodipine tablets and oral solution (liquid) at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. Store amlodipine oral suspension in the refrigerator, do not freeze. Usual Amlodipine Adult Dose for Hypertension: Initial dose: 5 mg orally once a day Maintenance dose: 5 to 10 mg orally once a day Maximum dose: 10 mg\/day Comments: Patients who are small or fragile may be started on 2.5 mg orally once a day.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "cardiogenic shock\/hypotension: In general, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should not be used in patients with hypotension (systolic pressure < 90 mm Hg) or cardiogenic shock. Due to potential negative inotropic and peripheral vasodilating effects, the use of CCBs may further depress cardiac output and blood pressure, which can be detrimental in these patients. The use of verapamil and diltiazem is specifically contraindicated under these circumstances.; coronary artery disease: Increased frequency, duration, and\/or severity of angina, as well as acute myocardial infarction, have rarely developed during initiation or dosage increase of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease and those treated with immediate-release formulations. The mechanism of this effect is not established. Therapy with CCBs should be administered cautiously in patients with significant coronary artery disease.; liver disease: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are extensively metabolized by the liver. The half-lives of CCBs may be prolonged substantially in patients with severe hepatic impairment, with the potential for significant drug accumulation. In addition, the use of some CCBs has been associated with elevations in serum transaminases, both with and without concomitant elevations in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. While these effects may be transient and reversible, some patients have developed cholestasis or hepatocellular injury. Therapy with CCBs should be administered cautiously and often at reduced dosages in patients with significantly impaired hepatic function. Periodic monitoring of liver function is advised.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "CHF\/AMI: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may have varying degrees of negative inotropic effect. Congestive heart failure (CHF), worsening of CHF, and pulmonary edema have occurred in some patients treated with a CCB, primarily verapamil. Some CCBs have also caused mild to moderate peripheral edema due to localized vasodilation of dependent arterioles and small blood vessels, which can be confused with the effects of increasing left ventricular dysfunction. Although some CCBs have been used in the treatment of CHF, therapy with CCBs should be administered cautiously in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., ejection fraction < 30%) or moderate to severe symptoms of cardiac failure and in patients with any degree of ventricular dysfunction if they are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocker. Likewise, caution is advised in patients with acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary congestion documented by X-ray on admission, since associated heart failure may be acutely worsened by administration of a CCB.",

  "Drug": "amoxicillin",
  "Description": "Amoxicillin is a penicillin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as tonsillitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, and infections of the ear, nose, throat, skin, or urinary tract. Amoxicillin clavulanate is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. The amoxicillin fights bacteria, and the clavulanate potassium helps prevent certain bacteria from becoming resistant to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin is also sometimes used together with another antibiotic called clarithromycin (Biaxin) to treat stomach ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. This combination is sometimes used with a stomach acid reducer called lansoprazole (Prevacid). Amoxicillin 500mg and 250mg are available as tablets or capsules and as an oral suspension. Many brands and forms of amoxicillin are available, and not all brands are listed on this leaflet. Common amoxicillin side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. These side effects affected more than 1% of patients in clinical trials. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling). Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects, and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may also report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Do not use this medication if you are allergic to amoxicillin or to any other penicillin antibiotic, such as ampicillin (Omnipen, Principen), dicloxacillin (Dycill, Dynapen), oxacillin (Bactocill), penicillin (Beepen-VK, Ledercillin VK, Pen-V, Pen-Vee K, Pfizerpen, V-Cillin K, Veetids), and others. Before using amoxicillin, tell your doctor if you are allergic to cephalosporins such as Omnicef, Cefzil, Ceftin, Keflex, and others. Also, tell your doctor if you have asthma, liver or kidney disease, a bleeding or blood clotting disorder, mononucleosis (also called \"mono\"), or any type of allergy. Amoxicillin can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using a non-hormone method of birth control (such as a condom, diaphragm, or spermicide) to prevent pregnancy while taking this medicine. Take this medication for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Amoxicillin will not treat a viral infection such as the common cold or flu. Do not share this medication with another person, even if they have the same symptoms you have. Antibiotic medicines can cause diarrhea. This may happen while you are taking amoxicillin, or within a few months after you stop taking it. This may be a sign of a new infection. If you have diarrhea that is watery or bloody, stop taking this medicine and call your doctor. Do not use anti-diarrhea medicine unless your doctor tells you to. You should not use amoxicillin if you are allergic to any penicillin antibiotic, such as ampicillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin, penicillin, or ticarcillin. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have: It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Amoxicillin can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using a non-hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge) to prevent pregnancy. It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk. Take amoxicillin exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Take amoxicillin at the same time each day. Some forms of amoxicillin may be taken with or without food. Check your medicine label to see if you should take your mediicne with food or not.

You may mix the liquid with water, milk, baby formula, fruit juice, or ginger ale. Drink all of the mixture right away. Do not save for later use. You must chew the chewable tablet before you swallow it. Swallow the regular tablet whole and do not crush, chew, or break it. If you are taking amoxicillin with clarithromycin and\/or lansoprazole to treat stomach ulcer, use all of your medications as directed. Read the medication guide or patient instructions provided with each medication. Do not change your doses or medication schedule without your doctor's advice. Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses can increase your risk of infection that is resistant to medication. Amoxicillin will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold. Do not share this medicine with another person, even if they have the same symptoms you have. This medicine can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using this medicine.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "colitis: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), formerly pseudomembranous colitis, has been reported with almost all antibacterial drugs and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin. Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development. Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity. Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "mononucleosis: Patients with mononucleosis treated with an aminopenicillin antibiotic, may develop a pruritic erythematous maculopapular skin rash. The rash is usually self-limiting and resolves within days of discontinuing the offending agent. An altered drug metabolism or an immune-mediated process unrelated to drug hypersensitivity has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Therapy with aminopenicillin antibiotics should not be administered in patients with mononucleosis.; diabetes: High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest®, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix®) be used.; PKU: Some amoxicillin chewable tablets and suspensions products contain phenylalanine. The phenylalanine content should be considered when these products are used in patients who must restrict their intake of phenylalanine (i.e. phenylketonurics).; renal dysfunction: Most beta-lactam antibiotics are eliminated by the kidney as unchanged drug and, in some cases, also as metabolites. The serum concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics and their metabolites may be increased and the half-lives prolonged in patients with impaired renal function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary and modifications should be based on the degree of renal impairment as well as severity of infection in accordance with the individual product package labeling. Renal function tests should be performed periodically during prolonged and\/or high-dose therapy, since nephrotoxicity and alterations in renal function have occasionally been associated with the use of these drugs.; hemodialysis: Penicillin antibiotics (except for agents in the penicillinase-resistant class) are removed by hemodialysis. Doses should either be scheduled for administration after dialysis or supplemental doses be given after dialysis.",

  "Drug": "ativan",
  "Description": "Ativan (lorazepam) belongs to a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It is thought that benzodiazepines work by enhancing the activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Ativan is used in adults and children at least 12 years old to treat anxiety disorders. Ativan is also used to treat insomnia caused by anxiety or temporary situational stress. Ativan is sometimes used to treat nausea and vomiting from cancer treatment and to control agitation caused by alcohol withdrawal. Ativan can slow or stop your breathing, especially if you have recently used an opioid medication, alcohol, or other drugs that can slow your breathing. These effects can be fatal. MISUSE OF ATIVAN CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep this medicine where others cannot get to it. Lorazepam may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person it was prescribed for. Ativan should never be shared with another person, especially someone who has a history of drug abuse or addiction. Do not stop using Ativan without asking your doctor. You may have life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if you stop using the medicine suddenly after long-term use. Some withdrawal symptoms may last up to 12 months or longer. Get medical help right away if you stop using Ativan and have symptoms such as: unusual muscle movements, being more active or talkative, sudden and severe changes in mood or behavior, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, or thoughts about suicide. Do not use Ativan if you are pregnant. Lorazepam can cause birth defects or life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in a newborn. You should not use this medicine if you have narrow-angle glaucoma, severe respiratory insufficiency, myasthenia gravis, or if you are allergic to Valium or a similar medicine. You should not use Ativan if you have: To make sure Ativan is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "acute alcohol intoxication: The use of benzodiazepines with alcohol is not recommended. Patients with acute alcohol intoxication exhibit depressed vital signs. The central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepines may be additive with those of alcohol, and severe respiratory depression and death may occur. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in patients who might be prone to acute alcohol intake.; closed-angle glaucoma: The manufacturers consider the use of benzodiazepines to be contraindicated in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma or untreated open-angle glaucoma. These agents do not possess anticholinergic activity but have very rarely been associated with increased intraocular pressure.; drug dependence: Benzodiazepines have the potential to cause dependence and abuse. Tolerance as well as physical and psychological dependence can develop, particularly after prolonged use and\/or excessive dosages. However, abrupt cessation following continual use of as few as 6 weeks at therapeutic levels has occasionally precipitated withdrawal symptoms. Addiction- prone individuals, such as those with a history of alcohol or substance abuse, should be under careful surveillance when treated with benzodiazepines. It may be prudent to refrain from dispensing large quantities of medication to these patients. After prolonged use or if dependency is suspected, withdrawal of benzodiazepine therapy should be undertaken gradually using a dosage- tapering schedule. If withdrawal symptoms occur, temporary reinstitution of benzodiazepines may be necessary.; renal\/liver disease: Benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, diazepam, flurazepam and quazepam undergo oxidative N-dealkylation to active metabolites that are substantially longer-acting than the parent compound. These metabolites then undergo further biotransformation to pharmacologically inactive products before excretion by the kidney. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously at lower initial dosages in patients with impaired renal and\/or hepatic function. Agents that are converted to weakly active, short-acting, or inactive metabolites may be preferable in hepatic impairment. Lorazepam, oxazepam and temazepam are conjugated to inactive metabolites, while alprazolam, estazolam and triazolam undergo hydroxylation to weakly active or inactive metabolites.; respiratory depression: Benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression and apnea, usually when given in high dosages and\/or by intravenous administration. However, some patients may be susceptible at commonly used dosages, including the elderly, debilitated or severely ill patients, those receiving other CNS depressants, and those with limited ventilatory reserve, chronic pulmonary insufficiency or other respiratory disorders. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in these patients. Appropriate monitoring and individualization of dosage are particularly important, and equipment for resuscitation should be immediately available if the parenteral route is used. Benzodiazepines, especially injectable formulations, should generally be avoided in patients with sleep apnea, severe respiratory insufficiency, or hypoxia.; seizures: The use of benzodiazepines in patients with seizure disorders may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). Appropriate anticonvulsant medication might need to be initiated or the dosage increased. Abrupt cessation of benzodiazepine therapy may precipitate seizures and other withdrawal symptoms, particularly after prolonged use and\/or excessive dosages. Status epilepticus may occur in patients with a history of seizures withdrawn rapidly from benzodiazepine therapy. Following chronic administration, cessation of benzodiazepine therapy should occur gradually with incrementally reduced dosages. Patients should be advised not to discontinue medication without first consulting with the physician.; prolonged hypotension: Benzodiazepines should not be administered by injection to patients in shock or coma. The hypnotic and hypotensive effects of these agents may be prolonged and intensified in such patients.; prematurity: Parenteral medications formulated in multidose vials often contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Their use is considered by drug manufacturers to be contraindicated in neonates, particularly premature infants and infants of low birth weight. When used in bacteriostatic saline intravascular flush and endotracheal tube lavage solutions, benzyl alcohol has been associated with fatalities and severe respiratory and metabolic complications in low-birth-weight premature infants. Thus, single-dose formulations should always be used in infants whenever possible. However, many experts feel that, in the absence of benzyl alcohol-free equivalents, the amount of the preservative present in these formulations should not necessarily preclude their use if they are clearly indicated. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers benzyl alcohol in low doses (such as when used as a preservative in some medications) to be safe for newborns. However, the administration of high dosages of these medications must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The level at which toxicity may occur is unknown.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "depression: Benzodiazepines depress the central nervous system and may cause or exacerbate mental depression and cause suicidal behavior and ideation. Episodes of mania and hypomania have also been reported in depressed patients treated with some of these agents. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of depression or other psychiatric disorders. Patients should be monitored for any changes in mood or behavior. It may be prudent to refrain from dispensing large quantities of medication to these patients.; obesity: The plasma half-lives of benzodiazepines may be prolonged in obese patients, presumably due to increased distribution into fat. Marked increases in distribution (> 100%) have been reported for diazepam and midazolam, and moderate increases (25% to 100%) for alprazolam, lorazepam, and oxazepam. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in obese patients, with careful monitoring of CNS status. Longer dosing intervals may be appropriate. When dosing by weight, loading doses should be based on actual body weight, while maintenance dose should be based on ideal body weight to avoid toxicity.; paradoxical reactions: Paradoxical reactions, including excitability, irritability, aggressive behavior, agitation, nervousness, hostility, anxiety, sleep disturbances, nightmares and vivid dreams, have been reported with the use of benzodiazepines in psychiatric patients and pediatric patients with hyperactive aggressive disorders. Such patients should be monitored for signs of paradoxical stimulation during therapy with benzodiazepines. The manufacturers do not recommend the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of psychosis.; upper GI disease: The manufacturer recommends the use of caution when prescribing lorazepam for prolonged periods in patients with upper gastrointestinal disease, especially in the elderly. The appearance or worsening of upper gastrointestinal symptoms should be monitored.",

  "Drug": "atorvastatin",
  "Description": "Atorvastatin is medication used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) levels to help prevent prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Atorvastatin calcium belongs to a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Atorvastatin calcium works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Atorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Atorvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with atorvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Common atorvastatin side effects may include pain in your bones, spine, joints, or muscles, pain and burning when you urinate, painful urination, muscle spasms, upset stomach, trouble sleeping, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, or pain in your arms or legs. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to this medicine (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling). Atorvastatin calcium can cause the breakdown of muscle tissue, which can lead to kidney failure. Call your doctor right away if you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness especially if you also have fever, unusual tiredness, or dark urine. Muscle problems may be more likely in older adults and those who have kidney problems, thyroid problems, or take certain other medicines. Also call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "liver disease: The use of most HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis, or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are extensively metabolized by the liver. Decreased drug metabolism may lead to accumulation and increased risk of toxicity, including biochemical abnormalities of liver function and, rarely, jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty change in the liver, and fulminant hepatic necrosis. Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of liver disease and\/or heavy alcohol use. A lower initial dosage may be appropriate, and clinical monitoring of liver transaminase levels according to the individual manufacturer product information is recommended. Patients who develop elevated ALT or AST levels during therapy should be monitored until abnormalities resolve.

Caution and close monitoring are advised when using these drugs in patients with renal dysfunction.; rhabdomyolysis: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred due to rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins. The myopathy may be dose-related and is characterized by unexplained muscle weakness, pain, or tenderness accompanied by increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal. Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy, in those with predisposing factors for myopathy, or with a history of myoneural disorder, since it may delay the recognition or confound the diagnosis of a drug-induced musculoskeletal effect. Patients should be advised to report promptly any unusual muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. Periodic CPK determinations may be considered in some patients, although the value of such monitoring is uncertain. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy should be withdrawn if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or if drug-related myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.",

  "Drug": "azithromycin",
  "Description": "Azithromycin is an antibiotic that fights bacteria. Azithromycin is used to treat many different types of infections caused by bacteria, such as respiratory infections, skin infections, ear infections, eye infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. Azithromycin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. You should not use azithromycin if you have ever had jaundice or liver problems when you have previously taken this medicine. You should not use azithromycin if you are allergic to it, or if: To make sure azithromycin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: This medicine is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether azithromycin passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. Take azithromycin exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. The dose and length of treatment may not be the same for every type of infection. You may take most forms of azithromycin with or without food. Take Zmax extended release liquid (oral suspension) on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. To use the oral suspension single dose packet: Open the packet and pour the medicine into 2 ounces of water. Stir this mixture and drink all of it right away. Do not save for later use. To make sure you get the entire dose, add 2 more ounces of water to the same glass, swirl gently and drink right away. Throw away any mixed Zmax oral suspension (extended release formulation) that has not been used within 12 hours. Throw away any immediate-release suspension that has not been used within 10 days. Shake the oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. Measure liquid medicine with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one. Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Skipping doses may also increase your risk of further infection that is resistant to antibiotics. Azithromycin will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Do not take antacids that contain aluminum or magnesium within 2 hours before or after you take azithromycin. This includes Acid Gone, Aldroxicon, Alternagel, Di-Gel, Gaviscon, Gelusil, Genaton, Maalox, Maldroxal, Milk of Magnesia, Mintox, Mylagen, Mylanta, Pepcid Complete, Rolaids, Rulox, and others. These antacids can make azithromycin less effective when taken at the same time. Antibiotic medicines can cause diarrhea, which may be a sign of a new infection. If you have diarrhea that is watery or bloody, call your doctor. Do not use anti-diarrhea medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Avoid exposure to sunlight or tanning beds. Azithromycin can make you sunburn more easily. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when you are outdoors. Avoid other drugs that can cause QT prolongation or irregular heart rhythm. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to azithromycin: (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling). Seek medical treatment if you have a serious drug reaction that can affect many parts of your body. Symptoms may include: skin rash, fever, swollen glands, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, severe weakness, unusual bruising, or yellowing of your skin or eyes. This reaction may occur several weeks after you began using azithromycin. Call your doctor at once if you have: Call your doctor right away if a baby taking azithromycin becomes irritable or vomits while eating or nursing. Older adults may be more likely to have side effects on heart rhythm, including a life-threatening fast heart rate.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "colitis: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), formerly pseudomembranous colitis, has been reported with almost all antibacterial drugs and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin. Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development. Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity. Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.; liver disease: Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice\/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin. Azithromycin is primarily eliminated by biliary excretion; however, the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin have not been established in patients with liver dysfunction. Therapy with azithromycin should be administered cautiously in patients with liver and\/or biliary disease. Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, with some fatal cases. Treatment should be discontinued immediately if signs\/symptoms of hepatitis occur.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "QT prolongation: Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval have been reported in patients receiving treatment with azithromycin.

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.; renal dysfunction: The use of bictegravir is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment, estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL per minute. It is recommended that before starting therapy, and during treatment to assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue this agent in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.; hepatitis B: Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in HIV-1\/HBV-coinfected patients who have discontinued products containing emtricitabine, lamivudine, and\/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) and may occur with discontinuation of tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 infection be tested for the presence of HBV before or when initiating products containing emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir DF, or tenofovir alafenamide. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in HIV-1\/HBV-coinfected patients who discontinue products (including fixed-dose combination products) that contain emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir DF, or tenofovir alafenamide. If appropriate, initiation or resumption of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.; hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity including lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, fulminant hepatitis, and hepatic failure has been associated with the use of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Therapy with NRTIs should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting liver disease, a history of alcohol abuse, or hepatitis. Therapy should be suspended if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. The use of abacavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe liver dysfunction as its safety and efficacy have not been established in these patients.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "hemodialysis: Emtricitabine is removed by hemodialysis. When started within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing, about 30% of the dose was removed over a 3-hour hemodialysis session (blood flow rate of 400 mL\/min and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL\/min). If dosing on day of hemodialysis, emtricitabine should be administered after hemodialysis.; renal dysfunction: Emtricitabine is primarily eliminated by the kidney. Dosage adjustment of emtricitabine is recommended for patients with CrCl below 50 mL\/min or in patients with ESRD requiring dialysis, in accordance with the manufacturer product information. Clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored.; bone toxicity: In clinical trials, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) was associated with slightly greater reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk have not been established. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial; however, the effect of such supplementation was not studied. Assessment of BMD should be considered for patients with history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. If bone abnormalities are suspected, appropriate consultation should be obtained.; liver disease: Tenofovir alafenamide (as a single ingredient product) is not recommended in patients with decompensated liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh B or C); safety and efficacy have not been established in these patients. No dose adjustment of tenofovir alafenamide is required in patients with mild liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh A).\n-Combination products containing tenofovir alafenamide have not been studied in patients with severe liver dysfunction; some of these products are not recommended for use in such patients. No dose adjustment of tenofovir alafenamide-containing products is required in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh A or B).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir after a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) have been studied in non-HIV infected subjects with moderate to severe liver dysfunction. There were no significant changes in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in subjects with liver dysfunction compared to those with normal liver function. No adjustment in tenofovir DF dosing is required in patients with liver dysfunction.; renal dysfunction: Tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Serum creatinine, estimated CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein should be assessed in all patients before\/when starting tenofovir (alafenamide or disoproxil fumarate [DF]) and during therapy when clinically appropriate. Serum phosphorus should also be assessed in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\nPostmarketing cases of renal impairment (including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy, and Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide-containing products; most cases had potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events and may have predisposed patients to tenofovir-related side effects. Tenofovir alafenamide should be discontinued in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.\n\nRenal impairment (including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome) has been reported with tenofovir DF. Close monitoring of renal function and dosing interval adjustment are recommended for all patients with CrCl less than 50 mL\/min. Creatinine clearance should be calculated in all patients before starting tenofovir treatment and during treatment when clinically appropriate. Routine monitoring of serum creatinine and phosphorus is recommended for patients at risk of or with a history of renal dysfunction. Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with renal dysfunction using dose adjustments; therefore, the benefit of tenofovir DF treatment should be weighed against the risk of renal toxicity. Renal function should be evaluated in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who have persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and\/or muscular pain or weakness (may be indicators of proximal renal tubulopathy).",

  "Drug": "botox",
  "Description": "Botox injection is a prescription medicine that helps improve the appearance of facial wrinkles, and treats some medical conditions, by causing muscles to relax, as botox blocks nerve signals to the muscles. Botox Cosmetic and Botox injections are both FDA-approved medicines, Botox Cosmetic is used to soften facial wrinkles, and Botox injections are used to treat medical conditions like chronic migraines, specific bladder issues, excessive sweating, and other muscle-related medical conditions. The difference between Botox and Botox Cosmetic is they are different strengths once the vial has been made up, and they have different FDA-approved uses. Therefore they should not be used interchangeably. Botox and Botox Cosmetic contain onabotulinumtoxinA, which is one of the botulinum toxins from the class of medicines called neurotoxins. Other botulinum toxins FDA approved medicines are abobotulinumtoxina (Dysport), incobotulinumtoxina (Xeomin), daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (Daxxify), prabotulinumtoxina (Jeuveau) and rimabotulinumtoxinb (Myobloc). Botox Cosmetic is used for: Botox is used for: You should not use Botox if you have an infection in the area where the medicine will be injected. This medicine should not be used to treat overactive bladder or incontinence if you have a current bladder infection or if you are unable to urinate (unless you routinely use a catheter). The botulinum toxin contained in Botox can spread to other body areas beyond where it was injected. This can cause serious life-threatening side effects. Call your doctor at once if you have a hoarse voice, drooping eyelids, vision problems, severe eye irritation, severe muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble breathing, talking, or swallowing. You should not be treated with this medicine if you are allergic to botulinum toxin or other ingredients contained in Botox or Botox Cosmetic, or if you have: To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Botox is made from donated human plasma and may contain viruses or other infectious agents. Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of contamination, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Ask your doctor about any possible risks. It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risks. Botox injections should be given only by a trained medical professional, which includes when used for cosmetic purposes. This medicine is injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider. How often you have Botox injections depends on the condition being treated, Botox Cosmetic injections for temporary improvement in the appearance of facial lines should be spaced at least 3 months apart, and for treatment for other conditions, it may be up to at least 12 weeks between injections. The effects of a Botox injection are temporary and your symptoms may return completely within 3 months. After repeat injections, it may take less and less time between injections before your symptoms return, especially if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin. You should not seek to have botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If you do switch healthcare providers, it is important to tell your new provider how long it has been since your last botulinum toxin injection. Using this medication more often than prescribed will not make it more effective and may result in serious side effects. Cosmetic use. Botox Cosmetic starts working or showing its effect usually in the first 1 to 4 days, with the maximum effect being reached in the first 1 to 4 weeks. The cosmetic effect usually lasts for 3 to 4 months but varies depending on each different individual. Chronic migraine prevention. Injections should be given in 7 specific head\/neck muscle sites, with the recommended re-treatment schedule every 12 weeks. Eye conditions. When receiving injections for eye muscle conditions, you may need to use eye drops, ointment, a special contact lens or other device to protect the surface of your eye. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions. For eye muscle spasms it may take only 1 to 3 days after injection before spasm symptoms begin to improve. You may notice the greatest improvement after 2 to 6 weeks. Excessive sweating. If you are being treated for excessive underarm sweating, you should shave your underarms about 24 hours before your injection. You should not apply antiperspirant or deodorant for 24 hours before or after you receive the injection. Avoid exercise and hot foods or beverages within 30 minutes before the injection. Neck muscle spasm. It may take up to 2 weeks after injection before neck muscle spasm symptoms begin to improve. You may notice the greatest improvement after 6 weeks. Adult bladder dysfunction. Before treatment, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for you to take for 1-3 days before your treatment, on the day of your treatment, and for 1 to 3 days after your treatment. For more detailed instructions (with pictures) about dilution, resulting strengths, how to use and where to inject Botox Cosmetic or Botox, read the \"Dosage and Administration\" on the Professional Botox Cosmetic document or Professional Botox document Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Overdose symptoms may not appear right away, but can include muscle weakness, trouble swallowing, and weak or shallow breathing. Botox may impair your vision or depth perception. Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how this medicine will affect you. Avoid going back to your normal physical activities too quickly after receiving an injection. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Botox: hives, itching; wheezing, difficulty breathing; feeling like you might pass out; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. The botulinum toxin contained in Botox can spread to other body areas beyond where it was injected. This has caused serious life-threatening side effects in some people receiving botulinum toxin injections, even for cosmetic purposes. Call your doctor at once if you have any of these side effects (up to several hours or several weeks after an injection): Common Botox side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.

  "Description": "Brilinta prevents platelets in your blood from sticking together to form an unwanted blood clot that could block an artery. Brilinta is used to lower your risk of heart attack, stroke, or death due to a blocked artery or a prior heart attack. Brilinta is also used to lower your risk of blood clots if you have coronary artery disease (decreased blood flow to the heart) and have been treated with stents to open clogged arteries. Brilinta is also used to lower your risk of a first heart attack or stroke if you have decreased blood flow to the heart. Brilinta is also used to lower the risk of stroke and death in adults with a blockage or decreased blood flow in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. This medicine is usually given together with low-dose aspirin. Carefully follow your doctor's dosing instructions. Using too much aspirin can make ticagrelor less effective. You should not use Brilinta if you have any active bleeding (including a bleeding stomach ulcer), or a history of bleeding in the brain. Do not use this medicine just before heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG). You may need to stop using this medicine for a short time before having surgery or dental work, to prevent excessive bleeding. Do not stop taking Brilinta without first talking to your doctor, even if you have signs of bleeding. Stopping this medicine may increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Brilinta may cause you to bleed more easily, which can be severe or life-threatening. Avoid activities that may increase your risk of bleeding or injury. Call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have bleeding that will not stop. You may also have bleeding on the inside of your body, such as in your stomach or intestines. Call your doctor at once if you have black or bloody stools, red or pink urine, or if you cough up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds. These could be signs of internal bleeding. Many drugs (including some over-the-counter medicines and herbal products) can cause serious medical problems if you take them with Brilinta. It is very important to tell your doctor about all medicines you have recently used. You should not use Brilinta if you are allergic to ticagrelor, or if you have: Tell your doctor if you have ever had: It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether Brilinta passes into breastmilk. Talk to your doctor before using Brilinta if you are breastfeeding. Take Brilinta exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Brilinta is taken together with aspirin. Use these medicines exactly as directed. Do not take more aspirin than your doctor has prescribed. Taking too much aspirin can make Brilinta less effective. Take this medicine at the same time each day, with or without food. If you cannot swallow a tablet whole, crush the pill and mix it with water. Stir and drink this mixture right away. Add more water to the glass, stir, and drink right away. Brilinta keeps your blood from coagulating (clotting) and can make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have any bleeding that will not stop. To prevent excessive bleeding, you may need to stop using Brilinta for a short time before a surgery, medical procedure, or dental work. Any healthcare provider who treats you should know that you are taking ticagrelor. Do not stop taking Brilinta without first talking to your doctor, even if you have signs of bleeding. Stopping the medicine could increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Ticagrelor may affect medical testing for platelets in your blood and you may have false results. Tell the laboratory staff that you use Brilinta. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

  "Drug": "bunavail",
  "Description": "Bunavail buccal films contains a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine is an opioid medication, sometimes called a narcotic. Naloxone blocks the effects of opioid medication, including pain relief or feelings of well-being that can lead to opioid abuse. Bunavail buccal films are used to treat opioid addiction. Bunavail is not for use as a pain medication. MISUSE OF OPIOID MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Using Bunavail during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Fatal side effects can occur if you use Bunavail with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing. You should not use Bunavail if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone (Narcan). To make sure Bunavail is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: If you use Bunavail while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on this medicine. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks. Ask a doctor before using Bunavail if you are breastfeeding. Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby. Use Bunavail buccal films exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use Bunavail in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to use more of this medicine. Never share Bunavail with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medicine in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away Bunavail is against the law. Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions. Rinse your mouth with water after the Bunavail film dissolves. Wait one hour after the medicine dissolves to brush your teeth to prevent damage to the teeth and gums. You should receive regular dental checkups while using Bunavail. If you switch between medicines containing buprenorphine, you may not use the same dose for each one. Follow all directions carefully. Do not stop using Bunavail suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine. You will need frequent blood tests to check your liver function. All your medical care providers should know that you are being treated for opioid addiction, and that you take Bunavail. Make sure your family members know how to provide this information in case they need to speak for you during an emergency. Never crush or break a Bunavail pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. This practice has resulted in death. Store Bunavail films in the foil pouch at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Discard an empty pouch in a place children and pets cannot get to. Keep track of your medicine. You should be aware if anyone is using it improperly or without a prescription. Do not keep leftover opioid medication. Just one dose can cause death in someone using Bunavail accidentally or improperly. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, remove any unused films from the foil pack and flush the films down the toilet. Throw the empty foil pack into the trash. INDUCTION dose: Day 1: Initial dose: 2.1 mg\/0.3 mg buccally; followed in intervals of approximately 2 hours with additional doses to a total dose of 4.2 mg\/0.7 mg to control acute withdrawal symptoms Day 2: a single dose up to 8.4 mg\/1.4 mg buccally. MAINTENANCE Treatment: Doses should be adjusted to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms; doses should be titrated to clinical effectiveness as rapidly as possible as gradual titration may lead to higher drop-out rates. -Progressively adjust in increments\/decrements of 2.1 mg\/0.3 mg to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. -Recommended target dose: 8.4 mg\/1.4 mg buccally once a day; range 2.1 mg\/0.3 mg to 12.6 mg\/2.1 mg Maximum dose: 12.6 mg\/ 2.1 mg buccally once a day. Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing. Do not drink alcohol. Dangerous side effects or death could occur. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Bunavail will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Bunavail: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur. A person caring for you should seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up. Call your doctor at once or seek emergency medical attention if you have: Serious breathing problems may be more likely in older adults and those who are debilitated or have wasting syndrome or chronic breathing disorders. Common Bunavail side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may have breathing problems or withdrawal symptoms if you start or stop taking certain other medicines. Tell your doctor if you also use an antibiotic, antifungal medication, heart or blood pressure medication, seizure medication, or medicine to treat HIV or hepatitis C. Opioid medication can interact with many other drugs and cause dangerous side effects or death. Be sure your doctor knows if you also use: This list is not complete. Other drugs may interact with buprenorphine and naloxone, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "drug dependence: Buprenorphine exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Each patient's risk should be assessed before prescribing buprenorphine analgesics, and all patients should be monitored regularly for development of such behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression); the potential for such risks should not prevent proper pain management in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed buprenorphine analgesics but use in such patients requires intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of buprenorphine, as well as intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse; prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose should be considered. All patients using buprenorphine for opioid dependence should be monitored for progression of opioid use disorder and addictive behaviors.\n\nBuprenorphine is sought for nonmedical use (including by individuals with opioid use disorder) and is subject to criminal diversion. These risks should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine. Strategies to reduce such risks should be used (e.g., prescribe smallest appropriate quantity, careful storage during use, proper disposal of unused drug).; respiratory depression: Buprenorphine analgesics are contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory depression. Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with buprenorphine. Patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of therapy or after a dosage increase. Prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose should be considered; however, naloxone may not be effective in reversing respiratory depression produced by buprenorphine due to its slow rate of dissociation from mu receptors.\n\nThe use of buprenorphine analgesics in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or without resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Buprenorphine-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive (including apnea), even at recommended dosages of buprenorphine analgesics; buprenorphine for opioid dependence should be used with caution in such patients with compromised respiratory function. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), buprenorphine analgesics may reduce respiratory drive, and the resulting CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure; these patients should be monitored for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, especially when starting therapy. Buprenorphine for opioid dependence should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances where cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Opioids may obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury; use of buprenorphine analgesics should be avoided in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.\n\nLife-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in older adult, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics (or altered clearance) compared to younger, healthier patients. These patients should be monitored closely, especially when starting and titrating buprenorphine analgesics and when coadministering with other drugs that depress respiration; alternatively, the use of nonopioid analgesics should be considered. Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with kyphoscoliosis.; CV disorders: Therapy with naloxone in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disorders should be closely monitored for hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and pulmonary edema in an appropriate healthcare setting. Clinical monitoring of cardiovascular status is recommended.; gastrointestinal obstruction: Opioid analgesics are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.; intracranial pressure: The hypoventilation associated with administration of opioid partial agonists can induce cerebral hypoxia and vasodilatation with resultant increase in intracranial pressure. Unless mechanical ventilation is provided, extreme caution is advised when opioid partial agonists are given to patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a preexisting elevated CSF pressure. Also, clinicians treating such patients should be aware that opioid partial agonists may interfere with the evaluation of CNS function, especially with respect to consciousness levels, respiratory status, and pupillary changes.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "adrenal insufficiency: Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often with use beyond 1 month. If adrenal insufficiency has occurred with a particular opioid, other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. Available information does not identify which opioids are more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.; hypotension: Buprenorphine may cause severe hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension, syncope) in ambulatory patients. Risk is increased in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by reduced blood volume or coadministration of certain CNS depressant drugs; these patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after starting or titrating buprenorphine. In patients with circulatory shock, buprenorphine may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure; buprenorphine analgesics should be avoided in patients with circulatory shock.; liver disease: Buprenorphine is metabolized in the liver, and its activity may be increased and\/or extended in patients with impaired liver function.\n-Buccal film or sublingual tablets: A dose adjustment is recommended for patients with severe liver dysfunction; patients with moderate or severe liver dysfunction should be periodically assessed for signs\/symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased buprenorphine levels.\n-IM\/IV injection: This product should be administered with caution in patients with severe liver dysfunction.\n-Subcutaneous injection or subdermal implant: The effect of liver dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of this product has not been studied. Due to the long-acting nature of the subcutaneous injection, dosage adjustments are not rapidly reflected in plasma buprenorphine levels. Because buprenorphine levels cannot be rapidly adjusted when using the subcutaneous injection, and because the subdermal implant cannot be titrated, patients with preexisting moderate to severe liver dysfunction are not candidates for treatment with these products.\n-Transdermal system: This product has not been evaluated in patients with severe liver dysfunction; because this product is only intended for 7-day application, use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with dosing in these patients should be considered.; QT prolongation: Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine have shown QT prolongation 15 msec or less; this QTc prolongation effect does not appear to be mediated by hERG channels. Based on these 2 findings, buprenorphine is unlikely to be proarrhythmic when used alone in patients without risk factors. However, these observations should be considered in clinical decisions when prescribing buprenorphine to patients with risk factors (e.g., hypokalemia, bradycardia, recent conversion from atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, baseline QT prolongation, subclinical long-QT syndrome, severe hypomagnesemia).; renal dysfunction: Buprenorphine is substantially excreted by the kidney; the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Buprenorphine has not been studied in patients with renal dysfunction; caution is recommended when used in patients with severe renal dysfunction.; urinary retention: Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. Urinary retention has been reported with buprenorphine.; liver disease: The safety and effectiveness of naloxone injection in patients with liver disease have not been established. Caution should be exercised when naloxone is administered to patients with liver disease.; renal: The safety and effectiveness of naloxone injection in patients with renal insufficiency\/failure have not been established. Caution should be exercised when naloxone is administered to these patients.; septic shock: Naloxone has been shown in some cases of septic shock to produce a rise in blood pressure that may last up to several hours; however, this pressor response has not been demonstrated to improve patient survival. In some studies, treatment with naloxone in the setting of septic shock has been associated with adverse effects, including agitation, nausea and vomiting, pulmonary edema, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. The decision to use naloxone in septic shock should be exercised with caution, particularly in patients who may have underlying pain or have previously received opioid therapy and may have developed opioid tolerance.; seizure disorders: Narcotic (opioid) analgesic agents may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures, and, at higher dosages, have been reported to induce seizures in patients without history of seizures. Patients with history of seizure disorders should be regularly evaluated for worsened seizure control during therapy. Prolonged meperidine use may increase the risk of toxicity (e.g., seizures) from the accumulation of the active metabolite (normeperidine).; biliary tract disease: Opioid agonists may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, which may increase biliary tract pressure. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions and transient elevations in serum amylase. Patients with biliary tract disease (including acute pancreatitis) should be regularly evaluated for worsening symptoms. Therapy with opioids should be administered cautiously in patients with biliary tract disease, gallbladder disease, or acute pancreatitis.",

  "Description": "Buprenorphine is an opioid medication used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD), acute pain, and chronic pain. Buprenorphine is used for opioid addiction to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms without causing euphoria or dangerous side effects and helps prevent relapse. It works by being a substitute for the drug being abused, so the patient has minimal discomfort, which allows the patient to focus on their recovery. Buprenorphine for OUD is used as part of a complete treatment program that also includes counseling and behavioral therapy. For opioid use disorder, buprenorphine is available as long-acting injections (Sublocade, Brixadi) and sublingual tablets (Subutex discontinued, generics available). Buprenorphine is used to treat acute pain that is severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and moderate to severe chronic pain that is not controlled by other medicines. For chronic around-the-clock pain, it is available as buprenorphine skin patches (Butrans) and buprenorphine buccal films (Belbuca), and for acute pain is available as an injection (Buprenex). Buprenorphine-naloxone combinations are also available to be used for opioid addication and include sublingual film (Bunavail), sublingual film and sublingual tablets (Suboxone), and sublingual tablets (Zubsolv). Buprenorphine's mechanism of action is that is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. Yes, buprenorphine is a Schedule III controlled drug, which means it has a potential for abuse more than those in Schedules 4 and 5. If abused, it may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. MISUSE OF OPIOID MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep buprenorphine in a place where others cannot get to it. Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose. Patients should have access to naloxone to treat opioid overdose based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as currently using a CNS depressant, a history of an opioid use disorder, or previous opioid overdose. Having naloxone available is important if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental exposure or overdose. Taking this medicine during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Fatal side effects can occur if you use this medication with alcohol or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing. You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to buprenorphine or: To make sure this medication is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: If you use buprenorphine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible Buprenorphine can pass into breast milk and may cause drowsiness and breathing problems in a nursing baby. Ask your doctor about any risk to your baby. Use buprenorphine exactly as it was prescribed for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Never use this medication in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Buprenorphine Sublingual (for OUD) Buprenorphine sublingual is usually taken only at the start of treatment for addiction (induction phase). Most people are later switched to long-acting buprenorphine (Sublocade injection or Brixadi injection) or another medicine that contains buprenorphine with naloxone (Bunavail, Suboxone, Zubsolv). You may receive your first doses of buprenorphine sublingual in a hospital or clinic setting until your condition improves. Use dry hands when handling the tablet. Place the tablet under your tongue and allow it to dissolve with your mouth closed. Do not chew the tablet or swallow it whole. If your doctor has prescribed more than 2 tablets per dose, place the correct number of tablets under your tongue at the same time and allow them to dissolve completely. Do not eat or drink anything until the tablet has completely dissolved in your mouth. Never crush or break a pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. Doing so could result in death. Extended-release buprenorphine subcutaneous injection (for OUD) Buprenorphine extended-release injection is given subcutaneously (just under the skin). Sublocade is given in the abdomen monthly, and Brixadi can be given in your buttock, thigh, upper arm, or stomach and can be given weekly or monthly. Sublocade should only be used when patients have received treatment with an oral transmucosal (used under the tongue or inside the cheek) buprenorphine-containing medicine for 7 days and are taking a dose that controls withdrawal symptoms for at least seven days. Sublocade is injected as a liquid. After the injection, Sublocade changes to a solid form called a depot. The depot may be seen or felt as a small bump under your skin at the injection site on your abdomen for several weeks. The depot will get smaller over time. Do not try to remove the depot, and do not rub or massage the injection site. Sublocade is part of a complete treatment plan that should include counseling. Brixadi should only be used if you are currently receiving buprenorphine treatment or if your healthcare provider has given you a test dose of buprenorphine first to see if you are able to tolerate it. If you are new to Brixadi treatment, the upper arm should only be used after 4 doses of Brixadi in your buttock, thigh, or stomach. Brixadi is injected as a liquid; after the injection, the liquid changes to a gel form called a depot. The depot is not always felt under the skin. Do not try to remove the depot. Brixadi is part of a complete treatment plan that should include counseling. Buprenex (buprenorphine injection) is used for pain, it is given by deep intramuscular or slow (over at least 2 minutes) intravenous injection at up to 6-hour intervals, as needed. Butrans skin patch is used for chronic around-the-clock pain. It is applied once a week and worn continuously for 1 week. Do not change your dose. Apply Butrans exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Your doctor will prescribe you the lowest effective dose for the shortest time needed. Do not take hot baths or sunbathe, use hot tubs, saunas, heating pads, electric blankets, heated waterbeds, or tanning lamps as these can cause an overdose that can lead to death. Belbuca buccal films are used for around-the-clock treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain. Using a finger, place the yellow side of the Belbuca buccal film against the inside of your moistened cheek. Press and hold the Belbuca buccal film in place for 5 seconds and then take your finger away. Once in place, the film will dissolve completely in about 30 minutes. Do not eat or drink anything until the Belbuca film has completely dissolved in your mouth. Rinse your mouth with water after the medicine dissolves. Wait one hour after the film dissolves to brush your teeth to prevent damage to the teeth and gums. Do not chew the Belbuca film or swallow it whole. You should receive regular dental checkups while using Belbuca. General information about using this medicine. Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law. You may need frequent blood tests to check your liver function. If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using this medicine. Any medical care provider who treats you should know that you are being treated for opioid addiction and that you are on buprenorphine. Make sure your family members know how to provide this information in case they need to speak for you during an emergency. Do not stop using this medication suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of your medicine. Buprenorphine is a drug of abuse, and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription. Do not keep leftover opioid medication. Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet. For detailed dosing information click the link below. Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. A buprenorphine overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness or weakness, cold or clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, slow heart rate, weak pulse, very slow breathing, or coma. Do not drink alcohol. Dangerous side effects or death could occur. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how buprenorphine will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to buprenorphine: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur. A person caring for you should give naloxone and\/or seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up. Call your doctor at once if you have: Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as: agitation, hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate, muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Common buprenorphine side effects may be more likely to occur, such as: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may have breathing problems or withdrawal symptoms if you start or stop taking certain other medicines. Tell your doctor if you also use an antibiotic, antifungal medication, heart or blood pressure medication, seizure medication, or medicine to treat HIV or hepatitis C. Buprenorphine can interact with many other drugs and cause dangerous side effects or death. Be sure your doctor knows if you also use: This list is not complete. Other drugs may interact with buprenorphine, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.

Patients at increased risk may be prescribed buprenorphine analgesics but use in such patients requires intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of buprenorphine, as well as intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse; prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose should be considered. All patients using buprenorphine for opioid dependence should be monitored for progression of opioid use disorder and addictive behaviors.\n\nBuprenorphine is sought for nonmedical use (including by individuals with opioid use disorder) and is subject to criminal diversion. These risks should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine. Strategies to reduce such risks should be used (e.g., prescribe smallest appropriate quantity, careful storage during use, proper disposal of unused drug).; respiratory depression: Buprenorphine analgesics are contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory depression. Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with buprenorphine. Patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of therapy or after a dosage increase. Prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose should be considered; however, naloxone may not be effective in reversing respiratory depression produced by buprenorphine due to its slow rate of dissociation from mu receptors.\n\nThe use of buprenorphine analgesics in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or without resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Buprenorphine-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive (including apnea), even at recommended dosages of buprenorphine analgesics; buprenorphine for opioid dependence should be used with caution in such patients with compromised respiratory function. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), buprenorphine analgesics may reduce respiratory drive, and the resulting CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure; these patients should be monitored for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, especially when starting therapy. Buprenorphine for opioid dependence should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances where cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Opioids may obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury; use of buprenorphine analgesics should be avoided in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.\n\nLife-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in older adult, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics (or altered clearance) compared to younger, healthier patients. These patients should be monitored closely, especially when starting and titrating buprenorphine analgesics and when coadministering with other drugs that depress respiration; alternatively, the use of nonopioid analgesics should be considered. Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with kyphoscoliosis.; gastrointestinal obstruction: Opioid analgesics are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.; intracranial pressure: The hypoventilation associated with administration of opioid partial agonists can induce cerebral hypoxia and vasodilatation with resultant increase in intracranial pressure. Unless mechanical ventilation is provided, extreme caution is advised when opioid partial agonists are given to patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a preexisting elevated CSF pressure. Also, clinicians treating such patients should be aware that opioid partial agonists may interfere with the evaluation of CNS function, especially with respect to consciousness levels, respiratory status, and pupillary changes.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "adrenal insufficiency: Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often with use beyond 1 month. If adrenal insufficiency has occurred with a particular opioid, other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. Available information does not identify which opioids are more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.; hypotension: Buprenorphine may cause severe hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension, syncope) in ambulatory patients. Risk is increased in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by reduced blood volume or coadministration of certain CNS depressant drugs; these patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after starting or titrating buprenorphine. In patients with circulatory shock, buprenorphine may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure; buprenorphine analgesics should be avoided in patients with circulatory shock.; liver disease: Buprenorphine is metabolized in the liver, and its activity may be increased and\/or extended in patients with impaired liver function.\n-Buccal film or sublingual tablets: A dose adjustment is recommended for patients with severe liver dysfunction; patients with moderate or severe liver dysfunction should be periodically assessed for signs\/symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased buprenorphine levels.\n-IM\/IV injection: This product should be administered with caution in patients with severe liver dysfunction.\n-Subcutaneous injection or subdermal implant: The effect of liver dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of this product has not been studied. Due to the long-acting nature of the subcutaneous injection, dosage adjustments are not rapidly reflected in plasma buprenorphine levels. Because buprenorphine levels cannot be rapidly adjusted when using the subcutaneous injection, and because the subdermal implant cannot be titrated, patients with preexisting moderate to severe liver dysfunction are not candidates for treatment with these products.\n-Transdermal system: This product has not been evaluated in patients with severe liver dysfunction; because this product is only intended for 7-day application, use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with dosing in these patients should be considered.; QT prolongation: Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine have shown QT prolongation 15 msec or less; this QTc prolongation effect does not appear to be mediated by hERG channels. Based on these 2 findings, buprenorphine is unlikely to be proarrhythmic when used alone in patients without risk factors. However, these observations should be considered in clinical decisions when prescribing buprenorphine to patients with risk factors (e.g., hypokalemia, bradycardia, recent conversion from atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, baseline QT prolongation, subclinical long-QT syndrome, severe hypomagnesemia).; renal dysfunction: Buprenorphine is substantially excreted by the kidney; the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Buprenorphine has not been studied in patients with renal dysfunction; caution is recommended when used in patients with severe renal dysfunction.; urinary retention: Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. Urinary retention has been reported with buprenorphine.; seizure disorders: Narcotic (opioid) analgesic agents may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures, and, at higher dosages, have been reported to induce seizures in patients without history of seizures. Patients with history of seizure disorders should be regularly evaluated for worsened seizure control during therapy. Prolonged meperidine use may increase the risk of toxicity (e.g., seizures) from the accumulation of the active metabolite (normeperidine).; biliary tract disease: Opioid agonists may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, which may increase biliary tract pressure. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions and transient elevations in serum amylase. Patients with biliary tract disease (including acute pancreatitis) should be regularly evaluated for worsening symptoms. Therapy with opioids should be administered cautiously in patients with biliary tract disease, gallbladder disease, or acute pancreatitis.",

  "Major Disease Interaction": "colitis: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), formerly pseudomembranous colitis, has been reported with almost all antibacterial drugs and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin. Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development. Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity. Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "renal dysfunction: Most beta-lactam antibiotics are eliminated by the kidney as unchanged drug and, in some cases, also as metabolites. The serum concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics and their metabolites may be increased and the half-lives prolonged in patients with impaired renal function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary and modifications should be based on the degree of renal impairment as well as severity of infection in accordance with the individual product package labeling. Renal function tests should be performed periodically during prolonged and\/or high-dose therapy, since nephrotoxicity and alterations in renal function have occasionally been associated with the use of these drugs.; diabetes: Use of cephalosporins may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine with certain methods (e.g., Clinitest tablets). Glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions are recommended for patients receiving cephalosporins.; dialysis: Most cephalosporin antibiotics are removed by hemodialysis. Doses should either be scheduled for administration after dialysis or supplemental doses be given after dialysis. Cefonicid, cefixime, and ceftriaxone are not significantly removed by hemodialysis.; liver disease: Cases of hepatitis have been reported with the use of certain cephalosporins. Transient rise in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels have also been observed. Caution and monitoring are recommended when these agents are prescribed to patients with hepatic disorders.; prolonged PT: Cephalosporins may be associated with reduced prothrombin activity\/prolonged prothrombin time. Risk factors include renal or liver dysfunction, poor nutritional state, prolonged antimicrobial therapy, and previously stabilized on\/receiving anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in at-risk patients and managed as indicated (e.g., exogenous vitamin K administered).; seizure disorders: Cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported with cephalosporins particularly in patients with a history of epilepsy and\/or when recommended dosages of cephalosporins were exceeded due to renal dysfunction. Dosage should be adjusted based on the degree of renal function. Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. If CNS adverse reactions including seizures occur, patients should undergo a neurological evaluation to determine whether treatment should be discontinued.",

  "Major Disease Interaction": "colitis: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), formerly pseudomembranous colitis, has been reported with almost all antibacterial drugs and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin. Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development. Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity. Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.; CNS disorders: Quinolones may cause CNS stimulation manifested as tremors, agitation, restlessness, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, toxic psychosis, and\/or seizures. Benign intracranial hypertension has also been reported. Therapy with quinolones should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to seizures or other CNS abnormalities. In addition, these patients should be advised to avoid the consumption of caffeine-containing products during therapy with some quinolones, most notably ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and cinoxacin, since these agents can substantially reduce the clearance of caffeine and other methylxanthines, potentially resulting in severe CNS reactions.; myasthenia gravis: Fluoroquinolones have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolones use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Fluoroquinolones should be avoided in patients with history of myasthenia gravis.; peripheral neuropathy: The use of quinolones has been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Monitor closely and discontinue their use in patients experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. It is recommended to avoid these agents in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy.; QT interval prolongation: Quinolones have been reported to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. QT prolongation may potentiate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsade de pointes. The risk appears to be greatest with grepafloxacin and sparfloxacin (both are no longer marketed in the U.S.), although cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to QT prolongation have also been reported rarely with others like gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Reported cases have primarily occurred in patients with advanced age, cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and\/or underlying medical problems for which they were receiving concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval. Therapy with quinolones should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation and\/or uncorrected electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) and in patients treated concomitantly with class IA or III antiarrhythmic agents. Cautious use with ECG monitoring is advised in patients with other proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial ischemia, and atrial fibrillation. As QT prolongation may be a concentration-dependent effect, it is important that the recommended dosages or infusion rates of these drugs not be exceeded, particularly in patients with renal and\/or hepatic impairment.; tendonitis: Tendonitis and ruptures of the shoulder, hand, and Achilles tendons have been reported in patients receiving quinolones, both during and after treatment. Avoid the use of these agents in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture. Therapy with quinolones should be administered cautiously in patients with patients with kidney, heart, and lung transplant, since it may delay the recognition or confound the diagnosis of a quinolone-induced musculoskeletal effect. Factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is recommended to discontinue these agents if, at any time during therapy, pain, inflammation or rupture of a tendon develops and institute appropriate treatment.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "crystalluria: Crystalluria has been reported rarely during quinolone therapy. Although it is not expected to occur under normal circumstances with usual recommended dosages, patients who are dehydrated (e.g., due to severe diarrhea or vomiting) may be at increased risk and should be encouraged to consume additional amounts of liquid or given intravenous fluid to ensure an adequate urinary output. Alkalinity of the urine should be avoided, since it may also increase the risk of crystalluria. Renal function tests should be performed periodically during prolonged therapy (> 2 weeks).; diabetes: The use of certain quinolones has been associated with disturbances in blood glucose homeostasis possibly stemming from effects on pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels that regulate insulin secretion. Hypoglycemia and, less frequently, hyperglycemia have been reported, although the latter may also occur due to infection alone. Hypoglycemia has usually occurred in patients with diabetes receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents and\/or insulin. Administration of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and especially gatifloxacin in patients treated with sulfonylureas or other oral hypoglycemic agents has resulted in severe, refractory hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma. Elderly patients and patients with reduced renal function are particularly susceptible. Blood glucose should be monitored more closely whenever quinolones are prescribed to patients with diabetes. Gatifloxacin has been known to cause hypoglycemic episodes generally within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurs 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy. Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations. If hypo- or hyperglycemia occur during quinolone therapy, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the antibiotic, and contact their physician.; hemodialysis: The following quinolones are known to be partially removed by hemodialysis and should be administered after dialysis: ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and ofloxacin.; renal dysfunction: Quinolones (except trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, and nalidixic acid) and their metabolites are eliminated by the kidney. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for adverse effects from quinolones, including nephrotoxicity, due to decreased drug clearance. Dosage adjustments may be necessary and modifications should be based on the degree of renal impairment and severity of infection in accordance with the individual product package labeling. Renal function tests should be performed periodically during therapy.",

  "Drug": "citalopram",
  "Description": "Citalopram is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat depression. Citalopram is also used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD). Citalopram belongs to a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to citalopram: hives, difficult breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Tell your doctor right away if you have new or sudden changes in mood or behavior, including new or worse depression or anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile, aggressive, restless, more active or talkative, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. Citalopram may cause serious side effects. Call your doctor at once if you have: Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as: agitation, hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate, muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Citalopram can affect growth in children. Tell your doctor if your child is not growing at a normal rate while using this medicine. Common citalopram side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Do not stop taking citalopram without your doctor's advice. Citalopram can cause a serious heart problem. Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain, fast or pounding heartbeats, shortness of breath, and sudden dizziness. You should not use citalopram if you also take pimozide, as the combination can cause problems with your heart rhythm. Do not use citalopram if you have used a MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days (such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine) or have received a methylene blue injection. A fatal reaction may occur. People with depression or mental illness may have thoughts about suicide. Some young people may have increased suicidal thoughts when first starting a medicine to treat depression. Tell your doctor right away if you have any sudden changes in mood or behavior, or thoughts about suicide. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as: mood or behavior changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile, aggressive, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), more depressed, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. Do not stop using citalopram without first asking your doctor. You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to citalopram or escitalopram (Lexapro), or if you also take pimozide. Do not use citalopram if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. Wait at least 14 days after stopping an MAO inhibitor before you take citalopram. Tell your doctor if you also use stimulant medicine, opioid medicine, herbal products, or medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. An interaction with citalopram could cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. To make sure citalopram is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: People with depression or mental illness may have thoughts about suicide. Some young people may have increased suicidal thoughts when first starting a medicine to treat depression. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your family or caregivers should also watch for sudden changes in your behavior. Taking this medicine during the last 3 months of pregnancy may harm the unborn baby, but stopping the medicine may not be safe for you. Do not start or stop citalopram without asking your doctor. If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of citalopram on the baby. Ask a doctor if it is safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Take citalopram exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Your dose needs may change if you switch to a different brand, strength, or form of this medicine. Avoid medication errors by using only the medicine your doctor prescribes. You may take citalopram with or without food, but take it the same way each time. Measure liquid medicine with the supplied measuring device (not a kitchen spoon). Your symptoms may not improve for up to 4 weeks. Tell your doctor if you have any changes in sexual function, such as loss of interest in sex, trouble having an orgasm, or (in men) problems with erections or ejaculation. Some sexual problems can be treated. Do not stop using citalopram suddenly, or you could have unpleasant symptoms (such as agitation, confusion, tingling or electric shock feelings). Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose. You may need frequent vision exams before starting treatment. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use. Usual Adult Dose for Depression: Initial dose: 20 mg orally once a day Maintenance dose: 20 to 40 mg orally once a day Maximum dose: 40 mg orally per day Comments: -The initial dose may be increased if necessary to 40 mg once a day after at least 1 week of therapy. -Doses of 60 mg\/day did not demonstrate an advantage in efficacy over 40 mg\/day doses. -Acute episodes of depression may require several months or more of sustained pharmacologic therapy Use: Treatment of depression Usual Geriatric Dose for Depression: Over 60 years of age: Recommended dose: 20 mg orally once a day Comments: -Doses of 60 mg\/day did not demonstrate an advantage in efficacy over 40 mg\/day doses. -Acute episodes of depression may require several months or more of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Use: Treatment of depression Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Ask your doctor before taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, and others. Using an NSAID with citalopram may cause you to bruise or bleed easily. Do not drink alcohol. Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how citalopram will affect you. Your reactions could be impaired. Citalopram can cause a serious heart problem. Your risk may be higher if you also use certain other medicines for infections, asthma, heart problems, high blood pressure, depression, mental illness, cancer, malaria, or HIV. Tell your doctor about all your current medicines. Many drugs can interact with citalopram, especially: This list is not complete and many other drugs may affect citalopram. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "depression: Adult and pediatric patients with depression and other psychiatric disorders may experience worsening of their symptoms and may have the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for worsening of their symptoms, suicidality or changes in their behavior, especially during the first few months of treatment, and at times of dose changes. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the treating physician. Discontinuing the medication should be considered if symptoms are persistently worse, or abrupt in onset. It may be prudent to refrain from dispensing large quantities of medication to these patients.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "renal dysfunction: Citalopram (racemic) and escitalopram (the more pharmacologically active S-enantiomer) are extensively metabolized and only small amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine. No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, as the oral clearance of citalopram has been shown to decrease only modestly (17%) in these patients compared to those with normal renal function. There is no information on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or escitalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 20 mL\/min). Therapy with these agents should be administered cautiously in such patients.; hyponatremia: Treatment with SSRI antidepressants can cause hyponatremia. Caution should be used when treating patients with hyponatremia or at greater risk of hyponatremia such as the elderly, patients taking diuretics or who are volume depleted.; liver disease: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are primarily metabolized by the liver. The plasma concentrations of SSRIs and their metabolites may be increased and the half-lives prolonged in patients with impaired hepatic function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary in accordance with the individual product package labeling.; mania: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), like other antidepressants, may occasionally cause or activate mania or hypomania. The reported incidence ranged from 0.1% to 2% in premarketing testing of several SSRIs. Patients with bipolar disorder are generally more likely to experience mania from antidepressants. Therapy with SSRIs should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of mania or bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, it is recommended to adequately screen patients for bipolar disorder, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.; platelet function: The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with altered platelet function. Petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis, increased bleeding times, epistaxis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been reported. Therapy with SSRIs should be administered cautiously in patients with severe active bleeding or a hemorrhagic diathesis.; QT prolongation: Some SSRI antidepressants such as fluoxetine and citalopram have shown to cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with congenital QT syndrome, a previous personal or family history of QT prolongation, and ventricular arrhythmia. Consider periodic EKG assessment on these patients. Treatment should be discontinued and a cardiac evaluation should be considered if a patient develops signs or symptoms of ventricular arrhythmia.; seizure disorders: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may trigger seizures in approximately 0.2% of patients, and some of them are not recommended in patients with unstable epilepsy. Therapy with SSRIs should be administered cautiously in patients with seizure disorders.; SIADH: The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has rarely been associated with hyponatremia, sometimes secondary to development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). These events have generally been reversible following discontinuation of SSRI therapy and\/or medical intervention. SSRI-related hyponatremia may be more common in elderly female patients and those who are volume-depleted or receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Caution may be warranted when SSRI therapy is administered in these patients and patients with preexisting hyponatremia or SIADH. Serum electrolytes, especially sodium as well as BUN and plasma creatinine, should be monitored regularly.",
  "Minor Disease Interaction": "weight loss: The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may occasionally cause significant weight loss, which may be undesirable in patients suffering from anorexia, malnutrition or excessive weight loss. Anorexia may occur in approximately 5% to 10% of patients. Weight change should be monitored during therapy if an SSRI is used in these patients."

  "Drug": "clindamycin",
  "Description": "Clindamycin is an antibiotic that fights bacteria in the body. Clindamycin is used to treat serious infections caused by bacteria. Clindamycin is usually available as one of three salts: clindamycin phosphate, clindamycin hydrochloride, or clindamycin nicotinamide. These salt forms are all prodrugs of clindamycin but once inside the body or applied to the skin, they are rapidly converted to active clindamycin by hydrolysis. All three salt forms of clindamycin: clindamycin phosphate, clindamycin hydrochloride, and clindamycin nicotinamide have the same antimicrobial spectrum and effectiveness. Clindamycin first gained FDA approval on February 22, 1970. Clindamycin phosphate is a salt of clindamycin that is usually used for injectable or topical formulations of clindamycin. Clindamycin hydrochloride is a salt of clindamycin that is usually used for oral formulations of clindamycin. Clindamycin may be used to treat a wide range of infections, although it should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and to maintain its effectiveness. Infections clindamycin treats in adults and children include serious: The most common clindamycin side effects include: Clindamycin may also cause a metallic taste in your mouth. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways you can manage this. Clindamycin carries a Boxed Warning for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Clindamycin can cause diarrhea, which may range in severity from mild to fatal colitis. Diarrhea associated with clindamycin use is sometimes caused by an overgrowth of dangerous Clostridium difficile bacteria in the large intestine. Seniors especially should be monitored for diarrhea. If you have diarrhea that is watery or bloody, stop using clindamycin and call your doctor. Do not use anti-diarrhea medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Seek urgent medical attention. Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction to clindamycin: (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling). Serious skin and other reactions can occur with clindamycin. Seek medical treatment if you have symptoms of a drug reaction such as skin rash, fever, swollen glands, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, severe weakness, unusual bruising, or yellowing of your skin or eyes. This reaction may occur several weeks after starting clindamycin. Call your healthcare provider at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Do not take clindamycin if you are allergic to clindamycin, lincomycin, Cleocin, Clindesse, ClindaMax, or any of the inactive ingredients in the clindamycin preparation you are taking (refer to the clindamycin Package Insert). To make sure clindamycin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Also, tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant or are breastfeeding. Animal studies have not shown any harm during pregnancy, but it is not known whether clindamycin will harm an unborn baby in humans. Clindamycin does pass into breast milk and may cause side effects in the nursing baby. If you are breastfeeding while taking this medicine, call your doctor if your baby has diaper rash, redness or white patches in the mouth or throat, stomach discomfort, or diarrhea that is watery or bloody. Let your doctor know if you are breastfeeding before taking clindamycin. Clindamycin injection may contain an ingredient that can cause serious side effects or death in very young or premature babies. Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice. Take clindamycin exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Oral clindamycin capsules are taken by mouth. Clindamycin injection is injected into a muscle, or as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself. Take the capsule with a full glass of water to keep it from irritating your throat. Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon). You may need frequent medical tests during treatment. If you need surgery, let your surgeon know you use clindamycin as it may interact with certain drugs used for anesthesia. Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses can increase your risk of infection that is resistant to medication. Clindamycin will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Protect the injectable medicine from high heat. Do not store the oral liquid in the refrigerator. Throw away any unused oral liquid after 2 weeks. Take clindamycin for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Skipping doses may also increase your risk of further infection that is resistant to antibiotics. Clindamycin will not treat a viral infection such as the common cold or flu. Use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Do not use clindamycin at the same time as erythromycin, another antibiotic. Other drugs may interact with clindamycin, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Tell each of your health care providers about all medicines you use now and any medicines you start or stop using. Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents, such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Use with caution. Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 hepatic enzymes, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N‑desmethylclindamycin. Caution should be used when using with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, such as clarithromycin, nefazodone, itraconazole, ketoconazole, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir. Caution should also be used when used together with inducers of these enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St. John's Wort, and glucocorticoids because concentrations of clindamycin may be reduced and it may not be as effective. This is not a complete list of interactions. See the clindamycin package insert for a complete list. prednisone, amoxicillin, doxycycline, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, metronidazole, dexamethasone, clindamycin, ceftriaxone Ingredients of clindamycin vary depending on the manufacturer. See the clindamycin package insert that corresponds to the clindamycin product you are using. Clindamycin is made by various manufacturers such as Baxter Healthcare, Northstar RX, Taro Pharmaceuticals, and Greenstone LLC.",

  "Major Disease Interaction": "colitis: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), formerly pseudomembranous colitis, has been reported with almost all antibacterial drugs and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin. Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development. Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity. Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.; prematurity: Parenteral medications formulated in multidose vials often contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Their use is considered by drug manufacturers to be contraindicated in neonates, particularly premature infants and infants of low birth weight. When used in bacteriostatic saline intravascular flush and endotracheal tube lavage solutions, benzyl alcohol has been associated with fatalities and severe respiratory and metabolic complications in low-birth-weight premature infants. Thus, single-dose formulations should always be used in infants whenever possible. However, many experts feel that, in the absence of benzyl alcohol-free equivalents, the amount of the preservative present in these formulations should not necessarily preclude their use if they are clearly indicated. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers benzyl alcohol in low doses (such as when used as a preservative in some medications) to be safe for newborns. However, the administration of high dosages of these medications must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The level at which toxicity may occur is unknown.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "liver disease: Clindamycin is primarily metabolized by the liver. The serum concentration of clindamycin may be increased and the half-life prolonged in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. In addition, jaundice and liver enzyme abnormalities may occur during use of the drug. Therapy with clindamycin should be administered cautiously in patients with liver disease. Dosage adjustments may not be necessary when administered every 8 hours. However, serum concentrations should be monitored during high-dose therapy, and periodic liver function tests should be performed during prolonged therapy.; renal dysfunction: Clindamycin is eliminated by the kidney to a limited extent. Therapy with clindamycin should be administered cautiously in patients with severely impaired renal function. Dosage adjustments are probably not necessary. However, serum clindamycin concentrations should be monitored during high-dose therapy, and periodic renal function tests should be performed during prolonged therapy.",

  "Drug": "clonazepam",
  "Description": "Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine (ben-zoe-dye-AZE-eh-peen). It is thought that benzodiazepines work by enhancing the activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Clonazepam is used to treat certain seizure disorders (including absence seizures or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) in adults and children. Clonazepam is also used to treat panic disorder (including agoraphobia) in adults. Clonazepam can slow or stop your breathing, especially if you have recently used an opioid medication, alcohol, or other drugs that can slow your breathing. MISUSE OF CLONAZEPAM CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Never share clonazepam with another person. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law. Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking clonazepam. Tell your doctor right away if you have any sudden changes in mood or behavior, or thoughts about suicide. Get medical help right away if you stop using clonazepam and have symptoms such as: unusual muscle movements, being more active or talkative, sudden and severe changes in mood or behavior, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, or thoughts about suicide. Do not stop using clonazepam without asking your doctor. You may have life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if you stop using the medicine suddenly after long-term use. Some withdrawal symptoms may last up to 12 months or longer. You should not take clonazepam if you allergic to it or if you have: To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking clonazepam. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your family or caregivers should also watch for sudden changes in your behavior. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you use clonazepam during pregnancy, your baby could be born with life-threatening withdrawal symptoms, and may need medical treatment for several weeks. Do not start or stop seizure medication during pregnancy without your doctor's advice. Clonazepam may harm an unborn baby, but having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. Preventing seizures may outweigh these risks. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant. Ask a doctor if it is safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice. Clonazepam is not approved to treat panic disorder in anyone younger than 18 years old. Take clonazepam exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Never use this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to use more of this medicine. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law. Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions. You will need frequent medical tests. Do not stop using clonazepam suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause increased seizures or unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose. Swallow the regular tablet whole, with a full glass of water. Clonazepam doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight. Remove an orally disintegrating tablet from the package only when you are ready to take the medicine. Place the tablet in your mouth and allow it to dissolve, without chewing. Swallow several times as the tablet dissolves. Your doctor will need to check your progress on a regular basis. Call your doctor if this medicine seems to stop working as well in treating your seizures or panic attacks. Seizures are often treated with a combination of drugs. Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Read the medication guide or patient instructions provided with each medication. Do not change your doses or medication schedule without your doctor's advice. Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. Keep track of your medicine. You should be aware if anyone is using it improperly or without a prescription. Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. An overdose of clonazepam can be fatal if you take it with alcohol, opioid medicine, or other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing. Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, confusion, muscle weakness, or coma. Do not drink alcohol. Dangerous side effects or death could occur. Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how clonazepam will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to clonazepam: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Clonazepam can slow or stop your breathing, especially if you have recently used an opioid medication or alcohol. A person caring for you should seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up. Tell your doctor right away if you have new or sudden changes in mood or behavior, including new or worse depression or anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile, aggressive, restless, more active or talkative, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. Call your doctor at once if you have: Drowsiness or dizziness may last longer in older adults. Use caution to avoid falling or accidental injury. Common clonazepam side effects may include: After you stop using clonazepam, get medical help right away if you have symptoms such as: unusual muscle movements, being more active or talkative, sudden and severe changes in mood or behavior, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, suicidal thoughts or actions. Some withdrawal symptoms may last up to 12 months or longer after stopping this medicine suddenly.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "acute alcohol intoxication: The use of benzodiazepines with alcohol is not recommended. Patients with acute alcohol intoxication exhibit depressed vital signs. The central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepines may be additive with those of alcohol, and severe respiratory depression and death may occur. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in patients who might be prone to acute alcohol intake.; closed-angle glaucoma: The manufacturers consider the use of benzodiazepines to be contraindicated in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma or untreated open-angle glaucoma. These agents do not possess anticholinergic activity but have very rarely been associated with increased intraocular pressure.; drug dependence: Benzodiazepines have the potential to cause dependence and abuse. Tolerance as well as physical and psychological dependence can develop, particularly after prolonged use and\/or excessive dosages. However, abrupt cessation following continual use of as few as 6 weeks at therapeutic levels has occasionally precipitated withdrawal symptoms. Addiction- prone individuals, such as those with a history of alcohol or substance abuse, should be under careful surveillance when treated with benzodiazepines. It may be prudent to refrain from dispensing large quantities of medication to these patients. After prolonged use or if dependency is suspected, withdrawal of benzodiazepine therapy should be undertaken gradually using a dosage- tapering schedule. If withdrawal symptoms occur, temporary reinstitution of benzodiazepines may be necessary.; respiratory depression: Benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression and apnea, usually when given in high dosages and\/or by intravenous administration. However, some patients may be susceptible at commonly used dosages, including the elderly, debilitated or severely ill patients, those receiving other CNS depressants, and those with limited ventilatory reserve, chronic pulmonary insufficiency or other respiratory disorders. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in these patients. Appropriate monitoring and individualization of dosage are particularly important, and equipment for resuscitation should be immediately available if the parenteral route is used. Benzodiazepines, especially injectable formulations, should generally be avoided in patients with sleep apnea, severe respiratory insufficiency, or hypoxia.; seizures: The use of benzodiazepines in patients with seizure disorders may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). Appropriate anticonvulsant medication might need to be initiated or the dosage increased. Abrupt cessation of benzodiazepine therapy may precipitate seizures and other withdrawal symptoms, particularly after prolonged use and\/or excessive dosages. Status epilepticus may occur in patients with a history of seizures withdrawn rapidly from benzodiazepine therapy. Following chronic administration, cessation of benzodiazepine therapy should occur gradually with incrementally reduced dosages. Patients should be advised not to discontinue medication without first consulting with the physician.; renal\/liver disease: The use of clonazepam is considered by the manufacturer to be contraindicated in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. Clonazepam is primarily metabolized by the liver, and the metabolites are eliminated by the kidney. Due to the possibility of excess accumulation of metabolites and the unknown effects of such accumulation, therapy with clonazepam should also be administered cautiously in patients with renal impairment.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "suicidal tendency: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical studies involving the use of 11 different AEDs showed that patients receiving AEDs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients receiving placebo. AEDs should be administered cautiously in patients with depression or other psychiatric disorders; phentermine-topiramate should be avoided in patients with history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. The risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior should be carefully assessed against the risk of untreated illness, bearing in mind that epilepsy and many other conditions for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients, caregivers, and families should be alert to the emergence or worsening of signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts or behavior. If patients have symptoms of suicidal ideation or behavior, a dosage reduction or treatment discontinuation should be considered.; depression: Benzodiazepines depress the central nervous system and may cause or exacerbate mental depression and cause suicidal behavior and ideation. Episodes of mania and hypomania have also been reported in depressed patients treated with some of these agents. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of depression or other psychiatric disorders. Patients should be monitored for any changes in mood or behavior. It may be prudent to refrain from dispensing large quantities of medication to these patients.; obesity: The plasma half-lives of benzodiazepines may be prolonged in obese patients, presumably due to increased distribution into fat. Marked increases in distribution (> 100%) have been reported for diazepam and midazolam, and moderate increases (25% to 100%) for alprazolam, lorazepam, and oxazepam. Therapy with benzodiazepines should be administered cautiously in obese patients, with careful monitoring of CNS status. Longer dosing intervals may be appropriate. When dosing by weight, loading doses should be based on actual body weight, while maintenance dose should be based on ideal body weight to avoid toxicity.; paradoxical reactions: Paradoxical reactions, including excitability, irritability, aggressive behavior, agitation, nervousness, hostility, anxiety, sleep disturbances, nightmares and vivid dreams, have been reported with the use of benzodiazepines in psychiatric patients and pediatric patients with hyperactive aggressive disorders. Such patients should be monitored for signs of paradoxical stimulation during therapy with benzodiazepines. The manufacturers do not recommend the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of psychosis.",

  "Drug": "cymbalta",
  "Description": "Cymbalta is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant (SSNRI). Duloxetine affects chemicals in the brain that may be unbalanced in people with depression. Cymbalta is used to treat major depressive disorder in adults. It is also used to treat general anxiety disorder in adults and children who are at least 7 years old. Cymbalta is also used in adults to treat nerve pain caused by diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), or chronic muscle or joint pain (such as low back pain and osteoarthritis pain). Cymbalta is also used to treat fibromyalgia (a chronic pain disorder) in adults and children at least 13 years old. Do not take Cymbalta within 5 days before or 14 days after you have used a MAO inhibitor, such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine, or methylene blue injection. Cymbalta should not be used if you have narrow angle glaucoma. Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as: mood or behavior changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile, aggressive, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), more depressed, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. Do not stop using Cymbalta without first talking to your doctor. You should not use Cymbalta if you are allergic to duloxetine. Do not take Cymbalta within 5 days before or 14 days after you have used an MAO inhibitor, such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, or tranylcypromine. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. Tell your doctor if you also use stimulant medicine, opioid medicine, herbal products, or medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. An interaction with duloxetine could cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Cymbalta is not approved for use by anyone younger than 7 years old. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have: People with depression or mental illness may have thoughts about suicide. Some young people may have increased suicidal thoughts when first starting a medicine to treat depression. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your family or caregivers should also watch for sudden changes in your behavior. Taking an SNRI antidepressant during late pregnancy could increase your risk of excessive bleeding after you give birth, and may cause serious medical complications in the baby. However, stopping the medicine may not be safe if you have a relapse of depression. Do not start or stop taking this medicine without asking your doctor. If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of duloxetine on the baby. If you are breastfeeding, tell your doctor if you notice drowsiness, feeding problems, and slow weight gain in the nursing baby. Take Cymbalta exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Taking Cymbalta in higher doses or more often than prescribed will not make it more effective, and may increase side effects. Swallow the capsule whole and do not crush, chew, break, or open it. Take with or without food. Your blood pressure will need to be checked often. Tell your doctor if you have any changes in sexual function, such as loss of interest in sex, trouble having an orgasm, or (in men) problems with erections or ejaculation. Some sexual problems can be treated. Your symptoms may not improve for up to 4 weeks. Do not stop using duloxetine suddenly, or you could have unpleasant symptoms (such as agitation, confusion, tingling or electric shock feelings). Ask your doctor before stopping the medicine.

  "Drug": "doxycycline",
  "Description": "Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth and is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. Doxycycline is used for bacterial infections, including acne, rosacea, urinary and respiratory tract infections, eye infections, gum disease, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Doxycycline can also be used to prevent malaria and treat infections caused by mites, ticks, or lice. Doxycycline hyclate and doxycycline monohydrate are two different salt forms of doxycycline available; one difference between the two is that doxycycline hyclate is soluble in water, while doxycycline monohydrate is very slightly soluble in water. Doxycycline 100mg, 75mg, and 50mg are the most common strengths of capsules and tablets available. It is also available as an injection, suspension, or syrup. The most common doxycycline side effects include nausea and vomiting, upset stomach, loss of appetite, mild diarrhea, skin rash or itching, darkened skin color, and vaginal itching or discharge. Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction to doxycycline (symptoms include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling). Seek medical treatment if you have a serious drug reaction that can affect many parts of your body. Symptoms may include skin rash, fever, swollen glands, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, severe weakness, unusual bruising, or yellowing of your skin or eyes. This reaction may occur several weeks after you begin using this medicine. Other serious doxycycline side effects may occur. Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects, and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "colitis: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), formerly pseudomembranous colitis, has been reported with almost all antibacterial drugs and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin. Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development. Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity. Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "hepatotoxicity: The use of tetracyclines has rarely been associated with hepatotoxicity. Histologic fatty changes of the liver, elevated liver enzymes, and jaundice have been reported, primarily in patients treated with large doses of intravenous tetracycline hydrochloride (no longer available in the U.S.) but also in patients receiving high oral doses of these drugs. Therapy with tetracyclines should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting liver disease or biliary obstruction. Reduced dosages may be appropriate, particularly with minocycline and doxycycline, since the former is metabolized by the liver and the latter undergoes enterohepatic recycling. Liver function tests are recommended prior to and during therapy, and the concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided.; esophageal irritation: The use of oral tetracycline capsules and tablets has been associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration in patients who ingested the drug without sufficient fluid shortly before bedtime. Therapy with solid formulations of tetracyclines should preferably be avoided in patients with esophageal obstruction, compression or dyskinesia. If the drugs are used, patients should be advised not to take the medication just before retiring and to drink fluids liberally.",

  "Drug": "dupixent",
  "Description": "Dupixent (dupilumab) injection may be used to treat moderate-to-severe eczema, moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype, eosinophilic esophagitis, or prurigo nodularis. Dupixent is self-administered by subcutaneous (under the skin) injection once every 1 to 4 weeks. Dupixent's mechanism of action involves specifically targeting and blocking 2 signaling proteins associated with inflammation called interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). This inhibits the inflammatory response including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE. Dupixent is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist. See What is Dupixent used for and how does it work? Dupixent first gained FDA approval on March 28, 2017 for eczema. Approvals of Dupixent for other indications followed. Dupixent belongs to the drug class interleukin inhibitors and may also be called a biologic. Dupixent is not an immunosuppressant, it just calms an overreactive immune system, relieving inflammation (see Is Dupixent an immunosuppressant? Dupixent is used to treat 6 different conditions with inflammation as a symptom. Dupixent reduces inflammation, relieving symptoms of eczema, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. FDA approval for Dupixent is granted under the following criteria. Dupixent is approved for eczema (atopic dermatitis) that is moderate to severe in adults and children 6 months and older whose condition is not well controlled with prescription treatments used on the skin (topical) or who cannot use topical therapies. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. In adults and children aged 6 and older Dupixent treats moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma in addition to other asthma maintenance treatments. Dupixent will NOT treat an acute asthma attack or status asthmatics (an extreme form of acute asthma). Dupixent is approved for inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis (a long-standing inflammation of the sinuses) with nasal polyps, as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and children aged 12 years and older. In adults, Dupixent can be used for inadequately controlled COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype as an add-on maintenance treatment. Dupixent is also used for eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and children 1 year of age and older, who weigh at least 33 pounds (15 kg) as well as prurigo nodularis in adults. The most common side effects of Dupixent are: The following additional side effects have been reported with Dupixent: Although weight gain is not listed as a side effect of Dupixent in the Package Insert, one case series and blog sites have reported that some people may gain weight. See Does Dupixent cause weight gain? for more information. Dupixent can cause the following serious side effects. Allergic reactions. Dupixent can cause allergic reactions that can sometimes be severe. Hypersensitivity reactions Dupixent has been associated with include anaphylaxis, serum sickness, angioedema, urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and erythema multiforme. Do not use Dupixent if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the ingredients. Stop Dupixent immediately and contact your healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms: Eye problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any new or worsening eye problems while taking Dupixent, including eye pain or changes in vision, such as blurred vision, conjunctivitis, or keratitis. If needed, your healthcare provider may send you to an ophthalmologist for an eye exam. See Why does Dupixent cause eye problems? for more information. Dupixent may cause inflammation of your blood vessels. Rarely, this can happen in people with asthma who receive Dupixent This may happen in people who also take a steroid medicine by mouth that is being stopped or the dose is being lowered. It is not known whether Dupixent causes this. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have: Joint aches and pain. Joint aches and pain can happen in people who use Dupixent. Some people have had trouble walking or moving due to their joint symptoms and in some cases needed to be hospitalized. Tell your healthcare provider about any new or worsening joint symptoms. Your healthcare provider may stop Dupixent if you develop joint symptoms. May increase the risk of developing eosinophilic conditions. Tell your doctor if you develop a red or purple rash, shortness of breath, or tingling or nerve pain in your hands or feet. Any pre-existing worm or parasitic (helminth) infections should be treated before initiating Dupixent. If patients become infected during treatment and do not respond to antihelminths, then discontinue Dupixent until the infection resolves. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need to continue with oral, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids while being treated with Dupixent. Corticosteroids should be reduced gradually, do not stop these suddenly without your doctor’s advice. Avoid receiving live vaccines with Dupixent because it may reduce how well your immune system responds to the vaccine. Dupixent will NOT relieve sudden breathing problems in asthma or COPD and will not replace an inhaled rescue medicine, such as albuterol. It is not known if Dupixent is safe and effective for children with: Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all of the possible side effects of Dupixent. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

  "Drug": "entresto",
  "Description": "Entresto is an oral combination prescription heart medication that contains two blood pressure-lowering medications: sacubitril and valsartan. Entresto is used to treat adults with long-lasting (chronic) heart failure to help reduce the risk of death and hospitalization and to treat certain children aged 1 year and older who have symptomatic heart failure. Entresto contains sacubitril and valsartan, which each have a different mechanism of action. Sacubitril works by blocking neprilysin, an enzyme that breaks down certain peptides in the body. This increases levels of beneficial peptides in the body which relax blood vessels and promote sodium and water excretion into the urine, reducing blood pressure. Valsartan blocks the effects of a hormone called angiotensin II, which can cause blood vessels to narrow and increase blood pressure. Entresto belongs to the class of medicines known as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi). Entresto gained FDA approval on July 7, 2015. Entresto is available as oral tablets and Entresto Sprinkle which can be sprinkled on food. Generic Entresto tablets are available under sacubitril and valsartan. The most common side effects of Entresto are: Entresto carries a Boxed Warning for fetal toxicity (harm to an unborn baby). Entresto or Entresto Sprinkle can harm or cause death to your unborn baby. Talk to your doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if you plan to become pregnant. Do not use Entresto if you are pregnant. Stop using and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant. Entresto can cause injury or death to the unborn baby if you take the medicine during your second or third trimester. Entresto can cause serious allergic reactions called angioedema which can cause swelling of your face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause trouble breathing and death. Get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing and do not take Entresto again. People who are African American, or who have had angioedema before, are at higher risk of developing angioedema. Do not take Entresto if you are allergic to sacubitril, valsartan (Diovan), Entresto, any of the inactive ingredients in the tablets or pellets, or if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction, such as angioedema (a serious swelling under the skin) to a blood pressure medication such as: Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Entresto such as hives; difficulty breathing; or swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Entresto should not be taken with an ACE inhibitor, or within 36 hours of taking one. If you have diabetes or kidney disease, do not use Entresto together with any medication that contains aliskiren (brand names Tekturna or Tekamlo). Low blood pressure is common during treatment with Entresto, especially if you also take water pills (diuretics). Call your doctor if you become dizzy, lightheaded, or if you develop extreme tiredness (fatigue). Kidney problems are common during treatment with Entresto and can be serious and can lead to kidney failure. Your healthcare provider will check your kidney function during treatment. Entresto may also increase levels of potassium in your blood and you will also be monitored for this. Increased amount of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia). Increased blood potassium levels are common during treatment with Entresto. Your doctor will check your potassium blood level during your treatment. Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "diabetes: The coadministration of some angiotensin II receptor blocker agents with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes.; angioedema: The use of these agents is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema related to previous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy or in patients with hereditary angioedema. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to these agents may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving angiotensin II receptor (AR) antagonists. Patients should be advised to immediately report any signs or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the medication until otherwise directed by their physician. Emergency therapy and\/or measures to prevent airway obstruction are required for angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx. Treatment with angiotensin II receptor (AR) antagonists should be discontinued permanently if angioedema develops in association with therapy.; hypotension: Angiotensin II receptor (AR) antagonists can cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and\/or sodium-depleted patients. Therapy with AR antagonists should be administered cautiously in such patients and in those predisposed to hypovolemic or hyponatremic states (e.g., patients on diuretic therapy, especially if high doses were used or if recently instituted; those on dietary salt restriction; renal dialysis patients). Volume and\/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to initiating therapy with AR antagonists, and the patient should be hemodynamically stable. Ideally, patients at risk for excessive hypotension should initiate AR antagonist therapy under close medical supervision, preferably with a lower dose, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of AR antagonist or diuretic is increased.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "CHF: Angiotensin II receptor (AR) antagonists can cause renal impairment in patients whose renal function depends on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In addition, symptomatic hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion. In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with AR antagonists has been associated with oliguria and\/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia, and death. Therapy with AR antagonists should be initiated cautiously in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and\/or sodium depletion. In patients who experience a decline in renal function, discontinuation of AR antagonist therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated. Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with AR antagonists, since therapy can usually be reinstated without difficulty after blood pressure stabilizes.; hyperkalemia: Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin, such as angiotensin II receptor antagonist system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of these agents with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Use caution when using these agents together and monitor serum potassium periodically.; renal impairment: Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure with these agents. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function with these agents.; renal\/liver disease: Valsartan is primarily eliminated by biliary excretion, and a minority is excreted in the urine. Dosage adjustments are not necessary in patients with renal impairment unless they are also volume-depleted, in which case therapy should be initiated under medical supervision. Likewise, patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction generally do not require a dosage adjustment. The manufacturer recommends administering valsartan therapy with caution in patients with impaired renal and\/or liver function, particularly if these conditions are severe.",

  "Drug": "entyvio",
  "Description": "Entyvio (vedolizumab) is used for ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease to help improve symptoms, induce remission, and may also reduce the need for steroid medicines to control symptoms long-term. Entyvio is a selective immunosuppressant that works to control inflammation and symptoms of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease by preventing too many white blood cells from entering your GI tract (intestine). Entyvio works selectively in the gut to decrease inflammation and does not usually lead to system-wide immunosuppression. Entyvio intravenous infusion is used as an induction treatment for ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. Entyvio Pen or prefilled syringe are used for the maintenance treatment of UC or moderate to severely active Crohn's disease and are given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Entyvio infusion became an FDA-approved medicine on May 20, 2014. Its indications are moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease in adults. Entyvio Pen (subcutaneous) became FDA approved on September 27,2023. No biosimilars of vedolizumab have been approved by the FDA. Entyvio belongs to the drug class called integrin receptor antagonists. Entyvio’s mechanism of action (MOA), or how it works, is by binding to α4β7 integrin on the surface of a type of white blood cell called memory T-lymphocytes. Binding to α4β7 integrin blocks it from interacting with MAdCAM-1 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1). This interaction plays a key role in causing the chronic inflammation seen in people with IBD. The most common side effects of Entyvio include fever, sore throat, flu symptoms; cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sinus pain, sneezing, cough with mucus, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, pain in your arms or legs, tiredness; headache, joint pain, back pain, rash, itching, or nausea. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Entyvio: hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Some side effects may occur during the injection. Tell your caregiver if you feel dizzy, nauseated, light-headed, itchy, sweaty, or have a headache, chest tightness, back pain, trouble breathing, or swelling in your face. Vedolizumab may cause a serious brain infection that can lead to disability or death. Call your doctor right away if you have problems with speech, thought, vision, or muscle movement. These symptoms may start gradually and get worse quickly. Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Entyvio infusion and pen can cause serious side effects on your brain or liver and may cause a serious infection. Call your doctor right away if you have a fever, tiredness, muscle aches, sore throat, shortness of breath, skin sores, painful urination, loss of appetite, upper stomach pain, dark urine, yellowing of your skin and eyes, or problems with speech, thought, vision, or muscle movement. Tell your caregivers if you have any reactions during the injection, such as dizziness, nausea, itching, headache, chest tightness, trouble breathing, or swelling in your face. Do not receive a \"live\" vaccine while using this medicine. You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to the active ingredient vedolizumab or any of the inactive ingredients. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis or if anyone in your household has tuberculosis. Also, tell your doctor if you have recently traveled. Tuberculosis and some fungal infections are more common in certain parts of the world, and you may have been exposed during travel. You should be up to date with all needed vaccinations before receiving this medicine. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Having active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease symptoms during pregnancy may increase the risk of premature birth or low birth weight. The benefit of treating these conditions may outweigh any risks to the baby. If you use Entyvio infusion or pen while you are pregnant, make sure any doctor caring for your new baby knows that you used the medicine during pregnancy. Being exposed to vedolizumab in the womb could affect your baby's vaccination schedule during the first few months of life. If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of vedolizumab on the baby. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Entyvio passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take this medicine. Entyvio infusion is given into a vein in your arm for UC and CD. Entyvio single-dose pre-filled pen is given under the skin (subcutaneously) as maintenance therapy for UC and moderate to severely active Crohn's disease. Before you start treatment with Entyvio, your doctor may perform tests to make sure you do not have tuberculosis or other infections. Entyvio is given as an infusion into a vein, usually once every 2 to 8 weeks. A healthcare provider will give you this infusion. This medicine must be given slowly, and the infusion can take at least 30 minutes to complete. You will be watched closely for a short time after receiving this medicine to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction. It may take up to several weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed, and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 14 weeks of treatment. Entyvio can be given subcutaneously (an injection under the skin) using the Entyvio Pen or single-dose prefilled syringe, for maintenance treatment of UC or CD after at least 2 intravenous infusions. See the detailed Instructions for Use that come with this medicine about the right way to prepare and give this medicine. Your healthcare provider will prescribe the type of device that is best for you. If your healthcare provider decides you or your caregiver can give your injections at home, you or your caregiver should be shown the right way to prepare and inject this medicine. Do not inject this medicine until you or your caregiver have been shown the right way by your healthcare provider. You may receive your first subcutaneous injection after at least 2 Entyvio infusions and in place of the next scheduled intravenous infusion. You may receive Entyvio as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous) 1 time every 2 weeks. Entyvio can be injected in your upper legs (thighs) or stomach area (abdomen). The upper arms may also be used if a caregiver gives the injection. You should use a different injection site each time you use the medicine. Do not give an injection into moles, scars, bruises, or skin that is tender, hard, red, or damaged. Always check the label of your prefilled syringe or prefilled pen to make sure you have the correct medicine before each injection. Do not shake this medicine. Following the first two Entyvio intravenous doses administered at Week 0 and Week 2, the dose may be switched to subcutaneous injection at Week 6. Comments: If you are not able to have your injection or infusion at your regular scheduled time or you miss a dose of Entyvio, inject the dose as soon as possible. Then, inject your next dose every 2 weeks thereafter. If you are not sure when you should have your next injection or infusion, call your healthcare provider. If you take more Entyvio than you were told to take, call your healthcare provider. Do not receive a \"live\" vaccine while using Entyvio, and avoid coming into contact with anyone who has recently received a live vaccine. There is a chance that the virus could be passed on to you. Live vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), rotavirus, typhoid, yellow fever, varicella (chickenpox), zoster (shingles), and nasal flu (influenza) vaccine. You may receive \"killed-virus\" vaccines such as a flu shot, polio vaccine, rabies vaccine, or hepatitis A vaccine. Ask your doctor before receiving any vaccine while you are being treated with Entyvio. Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Tell your doctor at once if you develop signs of infection. Tell your doctor about all your other medicines, especially: This list is not complete.

  "Major Disease Interaction": "infections: Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. Patients receiving immunosuppressants are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections including opportunistic infections. Caution should be exercised when considering their use in patients with severe or chronic infections. It is recommended to interrupt therapy in patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment and to monitor these patients closely for any sign or symptom indicative of infection.; PML: Immunosuppressive agents may increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Certain agents are contraindicated in patients who have or have had PML. Patients receiving chronic immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy or who have systemic medical conditions resulting in significantly compromised immune system function should not be treated with these agents. Health care professionals should monitor patients for any new sign or symptom suggestive of PML. Therapy dosing should be withheld immediately and an appropriate diagnostic evaluation should be performed at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML.; liver disease: Elevated transaminase levels with or without elevated bilirubin have occurred in patients who received vedolizumab. Care should be exercised when using this agent in patients predisposed to liver injury. Do not use vedolizumab in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "vaccination: Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations per current immunization guidelines. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine injection) and may receive live vaccines if the benefits outweigh the risks. Caution and close monitoring is recommended as there are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving vedolizumab.",

  "Description": "Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is an oral medication that may be given to certain people with diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease to improve their outcomes. Specifically, Farxiga is used to: Farxiga mechanism of action involves preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, and increasing how much is excreted in the urine. Farxiga works by inhibiting sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which is present in the proximal renal tubules and reabsorbs filtered glucose. By inhibiting this, Farxiga promotes the excretion of glucose in the urine. Farxiga also works by reducing the amount of sodium reabsorbed by the kidneys and increasing how much reaches the distal tubule. This is thought to influence several physiological functions including lowering the preload and afterload of the heart, downregulating sympathetic activity, and decreasing pressure inside the kidneys. Farxiga first gained FDA approval on January 8, 2014. There is no Farxiga generic. The most common side effects of Farxiga are: Farxiga can cause the following serious side effects. Diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine) in people with type 1 diabetes and other ketoacidosis. Farxiga can cause ketoacidosis that can be life-threatening and may lead to death. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition that needs to be treated in a hospital. People with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of getting ketoacidosis. People with type 2 diabetes or pancreas problems also have an increased risk of getting ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis can also happen in people who are sick, cannot eat or drink as usual, skip meals, are on a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates (ketogenic diet), take less than the usual amount of insulin, or miss insulin doses, drink too much alcohol, have a loss of too much fluid from the body (volume depletion), or who have surgery. Ketoacidosis can happen even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg\/dL. Your healthcare provider may ask you to periodically check ketones in your urine or blood. Stop taking FARXIGA and call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any of the following: If possible, check for ketones in your urine or blood, even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg\/dL. Dehydration. Farxiga can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or weak, especially when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). There have been reports of sudden kidney injury in people with Type 2 diabetes who are taking Farxiga. You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you: Talk to your healthcare provider about what you can do to prevent dehydration including how much fluid you should drink daily. Call your healthcare provider right away if you reduce the amount of food or liquid you drink, for example, if you cannot eat or you start to lose liquid from your body, for example from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long. Vaginal yeast infections. Women who take Farxiga may get vaginal yeast infections. Symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include: Yeast infection of the penis (balanitis). Swelling of an uncircumcised penis may develop in men who take Farxiga which makes it difficult to pull back the skin around the tip of the penis. Other symptoms of yeast infection of the penis include: Allergic reactions. Farxiga may cause an allergic reaction. Do not take Farxiga if you have a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to dapagliflozin, Farxiga, or any of the inactive ingredients in the tablets. Serious reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported. Farxiga should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes to improve blood sugar control because it may increase their risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Not recommended to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes with moderate to severe kidney disease (an eGFR of less than 45 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) (likely to be ineffective in this setting). Dosages of insulin or other medications that increase insulin release may need reducing to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Farxiga may increase the risk of hypoglycemia developing when combined with these medications. Serious, life-threatening cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene) have been reported in patients with diabetes prescribed Farxiga. If you develop pain or tenderness, redness, or swelling in your genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, see your doctor immediately. Some side effects may be more likely to occur in older adults. This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You should not use Farxiga if you are allergic to dapagliflozin, or if you have: To make sure Farxiga is safe for you, tell your doctor if you: Farxiga may cause harm to an unborn baby, especially the developing kidneys of an unborn baby. If you become pregnant while taking Farxiga, your healthcare provider may switch you to a different medicine to control your blood sugar. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to control your blood sugar if you plan to become pregnant or while you are pregnant. It is not known if Farxiga passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed if you take Farxiga. Take Farxiga exactly as your doctor prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Your blood sugar will need to be checked often, and you may also need to test the level of ketones in your urine. Farxiga can cause life-threatening ketoacidosis. Even if your blood sugar is normal, contact your doctor if a urine test shows that you have high ketones in the urine. During prolonged illness, you may become dehydrated. Call your doctor if you are sick with vomiting or diarrhea or if you eat or drink less than usual. Patients should be well hydrated before starting treatment with Farxiga. Recommended Farxiga dose for adults and children aged 10 and older for Type 2 diabetes to improve blood sugar control Usual adult dose of Farxiga for heart failure and kidney disease The Farxiga Package Insert recommends withholding Farxiga for at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Farxiga should be restarted once the person is clinically stable and has started eating or receiving nutrition again. Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Avoid drinking alcohol. Avoid getting up too fast from a sitting or lying position, or you may feel dizzy. Other drugs may increase or decrease the effects of Farxiga on lowering your blood sugar. Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using, especially: Farxiga will increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative ways to monitor glycemic control. It also interferes with some other laboratory assays. This list is not complete. Other drugs may interact with dapagliflozin, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Not all possible drug interactions are listed here.

  "Moderate Food Interaction": "Alcohol may affect blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Both hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur, depending on how much and how often you drink. You should avoid using alcohol if your diabetes is not well controlled or if you have high triglycerides, neuropathy (nerve damage), or pancreatitis. Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels if your diabetes is under control. However, it may be best to limit alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with your normal meal plan. Avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach or following exercise, as it may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.",

  "Major Disease Interaction": "liver dysfunction: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors ertugliflozin and canagliflozin are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to lack of clinical data. Sotagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and caution is recommended. The manufacturer's product labeling should be consulted for specific dosing of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with hepatic impairment.; renal dysfunction: The glucose lowering effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are decreased in patients with worsening renal function. Additionally, patients with impaired renal function (estimated GFR less than 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), older adult patients, and patients on loop diuretics may be more likely to experience adverse reactions related to volume depletion such as hypotension and acute kidney injury during therapy. Renal function should be evaluated prior to treatment initiation and monitored regularly in at-risk patients. Volume status should be assessed and volume depletion corrected before initiating therapy. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients undergoing dialysis is either contraindicated or not recommended. The manufacturer product information should be consulted for contraindications and indication specific renal dosing.",
  "Moderate Disease Interaction": "hypotension: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors cause intravascular volume contraction which may lead to symptomatic hypotension after treatment initiation, especially in older adult patients, patients with impaired renal function, patients with low systolic blood pressure, or those using diuretics. Volume status should be assessed and corrected before starting treatment and patients should be monitored during therapy.; infections: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors increase the risk of genital mycotic infections. Care should be exercised when using an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients who have a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised as these patients are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Patients should be monitored and treated appropriately.",
